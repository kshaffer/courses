## Course description




Media are produced and consumed today in dramatically different ways. Connected media practices provide a crucial frame through which students understand the evolution of film, television, and gaming in the digital era. This course explores an impending revolution in how screen media are created, circulated, and consumed. Specifically referring to a multi-platform entertainment experience, connected media practices also relate to a larger trend across the media industries to integrate digital technology and socially networked communication with traditional screen media practices.

## Overview

> Only through communication can human life hold meaning.  
-Paulo Freire, *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*, p. 77

> The future of digital culture — yours, mine, and ours — depends on how well we learn to use the media that have infiltrated, amplified, distracted, enriched, and complicated our lives. How you employ a search engine, stream video from your phonecam, or update your Facebook status matters to you and everyone, because the ways people use new media in the first years of an emerging communication regime can influence the way those media end up being used and misused for decades to come.  
-Howard Rheingold, *Net Smart*, p. 1

One of the chief goals of the Media and Public Engagement program is the empowerment of individuals to participate in, indeed to lead, efforts of civic engagement and community building through the use of new and emerging media. This means, of course, far more than passive consumption of media. Less obvious, it also means more than mindful critical thought in response to media practices, as important as that is. Our goal, in Rheingold's words, is to "influence the way . . . media [are] used and misused for decades to come," and to do so in ways that make a marked, positive impact on the world. In this course, we will pursue this goal in reference to *connective media*. 

Connective media is hybrid, in just about every sense of the word. Connective media hybridize the typically discrete types of media used — print and screen, broadcast and networked, static and interactive, top-down and bottom-up. Connective media hybridize the typically discrete roles of media producers — journalist and scholar, musician and marketer, writer and filmmaker, designer and programmer, social activist and game creator. Connective media hybridize the typically discrete roles of media consumers — reader, watcher, player, critic. And most importantly, connective media hybridize the typically discrete roles of media producer and media consumer.

Connective media is social. It both makes use of social networking technology and it emphasizes the role that media can play in social contexts.

Connective media is political. It flattens hierarchies, fuels activism, opens inter-class communication, creates a "mediated public space" ([Dorothy Kim](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/rules-twitter/)).

Connective media is entertainment, communication, social action, education.

In this course, we will explore recent and emerging developments in digital media practice. We will do so by reading about, watching, listening to, and participating in these practices. The course will culminate in a collaborative multimedia project where we learn by doing, and attempt in a small way to influence the future use and misuse of the media we employ.

### Weeks 9–13: Mini-MOOC

We will create a single, collaborative, multimedia, participatory cMOOC (Connectivist Massive Open Online Course). Based on our study of (and individual expertises in) a variety of media, we will design and implement a mini-MOOC. The class will select a topic, or better yet an activist goal, for the "course." Then we will set roles for individuals and/or small groups and set about creating the necessary media and other resources. During Weeks 11–13, we will partner with indie MOOC experts, [*Hybrid Pedagogy*](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com), to advertise and run our mini-MOOC. The community surrounding Hybrid Pedagogy is very active, and if we pick an interesting topic, we will have significant participation from around the world. It is also likely that members of that community will push our mini-MOOC farther than we intended, and we will need to respond quickly and flexibly.

### Weeks 14–15: Reflections

Following the mini-MOOC, we will reflect on the experience — what worked, what didn't work, which media fit which purposes, etc. Each student will write an essay on the experience and provide feedback to other students' on their essays. We will compile the essays into a collection and publish an ebook with [*Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing*](http://www.hybrid.pub). It will be a maker's version of ["Learner Experiences with MOOCs and Open Online Learning."](http://hybrid-pedagogy.github.io/LearnerExperiencesInMOOCs/)

## Assessment

The most important and interesting aspects of learning—especially at the graduate level—are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do, and *absolutely detrimental* to a class exploring emerging and disruptive practices, like this one.

That said, I am required to assign final grades for this course. My goal in grading is two-fold: to diminish their significance and the negative impact they can have on the learning environment, and to make sure that they do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

So grades will follow the following pattern: I expect no Ds and Fs, but those grades will be reserved for students who fail to internalize the "nuts and bolts" of the materials we engage. Cs will be given to students who sufficiently internalize that basic information, but no more. As and Bs are reserved for students who make push the boundaries of what is currently known and done with media. This can include producing new insights, creating new things, providing a nuanced critique of existing knowledge and practices, or connecting previously discrete domains of knowledge in new and insightful ways.

In order to ensure that all serious students in the class attain a basic working knowledge of the course material, I will set the standard for a C. To obtain a C in the class, students must pass a series of weekly quizzes that cover the raw informational content of the week's readings. Passing a quiz means getting at least 9 out of 10 questions factually accurate. Passing the series of quizzes means passing *all but two quizzes* during the semester.

Each week, students will submit informational or conceptual questions about the readings two days in advance of class. All students will see all submitted questions, and will be able to prepare (individually or in collaboration) answers to these questions. I will select questions from this collection for each week's quiz. While you will know the questions in advance of the quiz, you will not be allowed notes during the quiz. This will ensure that everyone has the basic facts fresh in their mind at the beginning of class, allowing us to go deeper with our critical discussion.

Generally there will be no makeups or reassessments; the two-quiz allowance should suffice for most cases. In exigent circumstances, other arrangements can be made at my discretion.

How exactly students may demonstrate the nuance, critique, and application required for an A or B will be negotiated among the class as we decide the details of the mini-MOOC and the final ebook.
