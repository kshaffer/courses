# Unit I: Pop/rock music (form, harmony, voice-leading)

Unit I will cover form, harmony, and voice-leading in pop/rock music, primarily from the latter half of the twentieth century, but also with some exploration of music from the twenty-first century. We will build on concepts learned in your previous studies of harmony and (especially) classical form, and add new details and concepts derived from the pop/rock musical repertoire.

The overall goal for this unit is for all students to be able to identify, interpret, and verbally explain the harmonic, formal, and voice-leading structures in example pop/rock songs.

## Materials ##

We will primarily be following the theories of Jason Summach, John Covach, Walter Everett, Mark Spicer, and Daniel Harrison. A very detailed exploration of the pop/rock repertoire from 1955–1990 can be found in Summach's dissertation (Yale, 2012). However, all required material for this unit (much of which is based on his work) will be posted here as we progress through the unit.

[specific materials to be added throughout the course of the unit]


## Concepts ##

Our coursework in this unit will be directed towards the goal of consistent, correct identification, interpretation, and communication of the following concepts or structural elements in the context of normative pop/rock songs.

Analytical concepts:

- **large-scale song forms** (strophic, AABA, verse-chorus)  
- **formal cycles** (start/end times and cycle types—A, AABA, VC, VPC, etc.)  
- **formal modules** (start/end times and module functions—verse, chorus, strophe, bridge, etc.)  
- **formal phrases** (start/end times and phrase types—statement, response, departure, conclusion, blues-tonic, blues-subdominant, blues-dominant, etc.)  
- standard **harmonic schemata and functional progressions** in pop/rock songs  
- standard **voice-leading practices** in pop/rock songs

## Assessment

Beginning in Week 3 of the unit, there will be weekly take-home assignments in which you will have an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the form concepts listed above (the first four) by identifying them in pieces of music not covered in class. You will receive at least two quiz opportunities for each concept during the unit. Upon taking the quiz, you will receive one of the following marks for each concept: **P – passing**, **A - attempted**, or **N – not attempted**. You must identify all or nearly all elements in the assignment correctly in order to pass the concept.

If by the end of the unit, you have passed all four of these concepts *on a single assignment* by Week 5, you will be guaranteed at least a C for the unit and progress on to the unit *oral exam* (see below). If you do not pass all four of these concepts by Week 5, you will have a reassessment opportunity during Week 6 in which you can attempt to bring your unit grade up to a C. Students that end Week 6 with 2 or 3 concepts passed on their best Unit I assignment will receive a D for the unit. 0 or 1 concepts, an F for the unit.

Students who pass all four form ID concepts by Week 5 will have the opportunity to take an oral exam *with a single partner* to demonstrate a higher level of interpretive knowledge. Each pair of students will receive a 20-minute time slot (in lieu of class meetings and office hours during Week 6). Students will have 5–10 minutes to give an oral presentation, read a prepared written presentation, or show a video that explains and interprets the harmony, formal structure, and voice-leading of a pop/rock song of their choice. Students that *explain with nuance and with reference to standard patterns or historical context* two of the three structural areas (harmony, form, voice-leading) will receive a B. Students who do so for all three areas will receive an A.

There will be no Unit I reassessments after Week 6.
