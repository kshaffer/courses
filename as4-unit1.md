# Unit I: Modulation and tonal harmony #

Unit I will comprise the end of your study of tonal Western music in the core Aural Skills course sequence. We will build on work on sight-singing, listening, diatonic harmony, chromatic harmony, and modulation from Aural Skills I–III, with a goal toward solidifying your skills in performing modulating melodies from sight, dictating/transcribing multi-voice harmonic textures, and analyzing harmonic progressions by ear, including those that modulate.

## Materials ##

In addition to exercises in the Berkowitz and/or Kazez texts, the following materials will be assigned or may supplement assigned materials in order to help you meet the goals outlined under *Concepts and assessment*, most of which can be found on Kris Shaffer's [Musicianship Resources](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship) website (which also contains helpful review materials). This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.

## Concepts and assessment ##

The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the [syllabus]({{ root_url }}/auralskills4.html)) are divided into two categories: *modulation* and *harmony*. They are listed below, followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as "I can . . ."

**Modulation (Unit I)**

- perform a modulating melody from sight (sung) – 1x  
- perform modulating harmonic progressions (at the keyboard) with preparation – 1x  
- transcribe/dictate a modulating melody quickly, without an instrument – 2x (multiple melodies on each assessment activity)  
- transcribe/dictate all lines of a four-voice homophonic texture quickly (with or without an instrument) – 1x  

**Harmony (Unit I)**

- transcribe/dictate harmonic progressions in a modulating passage using appropriate Roman numerals – 2x  
- transcribe/dictate harmonic progressions in a modulating passage using appropriate functional-bass symbols – 2x  
- recognize modulations by ear in a sonata or minuet movement in a symphonic, chamber, or keyboard texture – 2x  

In-class or take-home/online assessment activities will be given for all of these concepts and skills. These assignments and quizzes will provide sufficient opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery by the unit deadline. Additional attempts then become the responsibility of the student to be submitted or performed during office hours.
