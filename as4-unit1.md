# Unit I: Modulation and tonal harmony #

Unit I will comprise the end of your study of tonal Western music in the core Aural Skills course sequence. We will build on work on sight-reading, listening, diatonic harmony, chromatic harmony, and modulation from Aural Skills I–III, with a goal toward solidifying your skills in performing modulating melodies from sight, dictating/transcribing multi-voice harmonic textures, and analyzing harmonic progressions by ear, focusing those that modulate.

## Materials ##

The following materials will be assigned or may supplement assigned materials in order to help you meet the goals outlined under *Concepts and assessment*. Most come from [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com) (which also contains helpful review materials). This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.

## Concepts and assessment ##

The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the [syllabus]({{ root_url }}/auralskills4.html)) are divided into two categories: *modulation* and *harmony*. They are listed below, followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as "I can . . ."

**Modulation (Unit I)**

- perform a modulating melody from sight (sung with solfège) – 1x  
- perform a modulating melody from sight (instrument of choice) – 1x  
- transcribe/dictate a modulating melody quickly, without an instrument (take-home and/or *with* an instrument qualifies for half-credit) – 2x  
- transcribe/dictate all lines of a four-voice homophonic texture with appropriate harmonic labels), slowly (take-home) and with or without an instrument – 2x  
- transcribe/dictate all lines of a four-voice homophonic texture with appropriate harmonic labels), quickly (in-class) and without an instrument – 2x
