Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## September 8 prep

Listen to “I Am the Walrus” following along with the model transcription distributed in class (not posted on the open web because of copyright concerns). Play special attention to areas that gave you trouble, and use a keyboard or another instrument to guide you in singing and/or playing the chord progressions in the song.

Read/watch the [Open Music Theory resource](http://openmusictheory.com/syncopation.html) on transcribing syncopated rhythms in pop/rock music before Monday’s class. Come with any questions you have.


## September 3 prep

Read about Rock's "tonal systems" at [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockHarmony.html) (bottom of the page; follow all four links).

Find a recording of "I Am the Walrus" by The Beatles, and transcribe the bass line for 0:21–1:03. Then provide a Roman numeral analysis underneath the bass line based on what you hear. Be careful with chord qualities, as not all of them match the standard qualities for major/minor tonality. Lastly, write down any schemas or "tonal systems" that you think are influencing part or all of the passage. Bring your transcription to class.

## August 27 prep

Read the following and come to class with any questions you have.
