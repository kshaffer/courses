Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## October 22 prep

Please take a look at the additional materials on [Improvizing a sentence with galant schemata](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) and review the cadence schemata that were added to the [schema summary page](http://openmusictheory.com/schemataSummary.html). We will spend some time working further on improvising complete themes using these schemata.

## October 20 prep

For Monday, please put together and submit your [pop/rock performance project](as3-popRockPerf.html). (Shaffer section has an extension on this—we'll discuss in class on Monday.)

Also, please read the OMT page on [Improvizing a sentence with galant schemata](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) and watch the (9 minute) video at the end. Please omit the material and exercises that follow the video under "Putting it together." That will be for Wednesday.

## October 15 prep

Read the [Unit II Guide](as3-unit2.html), and bring to class any questions you have about it. Optionally, bring your primary instrument to class.

## October 13 prep

All transcriptions must be completed, approved by at least two classmates, and submitted by the start of class in order to count toward the Unit II grade. You will have until Oct. 20 to complete performances.

## October 6 prep

*Either* find three classmates to approve your performance-ready transcription *or* get your transcription into performance-ready shape by Monday. Let's get all the transcriptions finished, solid, and in for assessment this week.

## October 1 prep

If you are confident in the status of your transcription project, seek out classmates to provide official approval, per [the project guidelines](as3-trans.html). Otherwise, seek feedback (from me or your peers) or wait for feedback from me before proceeding.

Also, start thinking about options for the [performance project](as3-popRockPerf.html).

Finally, if practical, please bring your primary instrument to class on Wednesday.

## September 29 prep

Based on the comments you have received thus far (comments from me are coming soon if you haven't already received them), finish a complete draft of your transcription for Monday. Please send to me electronically (email or GDrive) before class.

## September 24 prep

Fix your transcription based on the comments you received from you colleague. *Do not* simply make changes they suggest, but examine their comments carefully to see if they are helpful/correct or not. (You will receive many comments for musical improvement in your career, and not all of them will be helpful.) If you are in good shape, you can also begin to work on the remainder of the song. Complete drafts will be due on Sept. 29.

## September 22 peer-review assignment

Send an electronic copy of your transcription (PDF required; notation program file optional) as well as a link to your recording online to the partner you worked with in class on the 17th. Also, send me a copy of your transcription as it currently stands (email is fine, or share on Google Drive).

Then provide detailed, strategic feedback on your partner's transcription in an email to them that is copied to me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu), before Monday's class.

Finally, come to class ready to sing (some of) your colleagues' transcriptions with a critical eye/ear.

## September 17 prep

Fix any issues noted by your classmate(s) on 9/15. Take note of both specific notes/chords/passages *and* any general trends noted that may come up elsewhere.

Then complete your [transcription](as3-trans.html) of the remainder of the musical texture for your first cycle (i.e., all vocals, instrumental lines, bass, chords). 

If your transcription is not already in notation software, typeset it in Finale, Sibelius, MuseScore, NoteFlight, Lilypond, etc., and bring it to class. (You can bring your own computer, or you can upload it to your Google Drive account and open it on the lab computer, assuming software and versions are the same. – I know MuseScore is up-to-date, and NoteFlight is web-based, so that will work with little/no difficulty, as well.)

## September 15 prep

Transcribe two of the following elements of the first cycle (through the end of the first chorus or first AABA unit) of your transcription project song: melody, bass, chords (lead-sheet and RNs). Bring the transcription to class. If the song is not on Spotify, bring audio to share with a classmate as you critique each other’s transcriptions. Notation software is not required, but you may want to begin entering it into Finale, Sibelius, MuseScore, NoteFlight, or Lilypond, since your transcription should be in notation software for the 17th. If you have never used notation software before, I highly recommend [MuseScore](http://musescore.org).


## September 10 prep

1. Transcribe the melody of the first cycle of St. Vincent, “Digital Witness”: 0:00–1:05 ([Spotify web](http://open.spotify.com/track/5L16tlSHNt93RiiRiCc8ya), [Spotify app](spotify:track:5L16tlSHNt93RiiRiCc8ya)). Be sure to include key signature, and be precise as possible with the rhythm and pitch of the melody. Though not required, both using notation software and transcribing the lyrics may help you in the transcription process.

2. Choose a song for big transcription project. Either select a song from the list provided, or suggest a song of your own choosing for instructor approval. The project will involve the transcription of melody, bass, chords, and any vocal or instrumental parts that constitute something other than block chords, so take all of those parameters into account when choosing a song. Transcription project details can be found [here](as3-trans.html).


## September 8 prep

Listen to “I Am the Walrus” following along with the model transcription distributed in class (not posted on the open web because of copyright concerns). Play special attention to areas that gave you trouble, and use a keyboard or another instrument to guide you in singing and/or playing the chord progressions in the song.

Read/watch the [Open Music Theory resource](http://openmusictheory.com/syncopation.html) on transcribing syncopated rhythms in pop/rock music before Monday’s class. Come with any questions you have.


## September 3 prep

Read about Rock's "tonal systems" at [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockHarmony.html) (bottom of the page; follow all four links).

Find a recording of "I Am the Walrus" by The Beatles, and transcribe the bass line for 0:21–1:03. Then provide a Roman numeral analysis underneath the bass line based on what you hear. Be careful with chord qualities, as not all of them match the standard qualities for major/minor tonality. Lastly, write down any schemas or "tonal systems" that you think are influencing part or all of the passage. Bring your transcription to class.

## August 27 prep

Read the following and come to class with any questions you have.

- [Syllabus](auralskills3.html)  
- [Unit I Guide](as3-unit1.html)  
- ["An Open Letter to My Students"](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-letter-students/)  
- [Harmony in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockHarmony.html) (only the schemas, not the "tonal systems")
