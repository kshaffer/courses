In general, be professional, take responsibility for your own learning and musical development, and follow all university policies, and you will be fine. See below for some specific policies (most of which are *university* policies, not instructor policies).

## Attendance ##

I do not grade attendance directly. Nor do I grade assignment completion, give points for "effort," accept late work, or give extra credit. Exceptions can be made for students who are diligent in their work, petition for an exception *in writing* as soon as they realize that an exception may be needed, and make a legitimate case that an exception is warranted. 

## Religious observances ##

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. For this course, see the above attendance policy, and make arrangements *in advance* with me and with your workgroup colleagues (if appropriate).

## Disabilities ##

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at [dsinfo@colorado.edu](mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu).

If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries under Quick Links at [Disability Services website](http://disabilityservices.colorado.edu/) and discuss your needs with your professor.

If you *suspect* that an undiagnosed learning disability is affecting your work in this course, please talk to me immediately. I have experience both in spotting the warning signs of undiagnosed learning disabilities, as well as figuring out workarounds for studying and working with things such as dyslexia and central aduitory processing disorder. (I also know which tasks in this course are most likely to cause trouble for students with certain learning disabilities.) Those workarounds and study tips do not constitute accomodations, but will likely be *more* helpful to you than official course accomodations and do not require an official diagnosis. (If they work, they work.) Please avail yourself of my experience and willingness to help at the first sign of a potential learning disability.

## Classroom behavior ##

Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteranâ€™s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at [http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html) and at [http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code](http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code).

## Discrimination and harassment ##

The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. The University of Colorado does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its educational programs and activities. (Regent Law, Article 10, amended 11/8/2001). CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, "Protected Classes" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or veteran status. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be obtained at [http://hr.colorado.edu/dh/](http://hr.colorado.edu/dh/).

## Honor code ##

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council ([honor@colorado.edu](mailto:honor@colorado.edu); 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at [http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html) and at [http://honorcode.colorado.edu](http://honorcode.colorado.edu).

Please note that I received my undergraduate degree from an institution with an honor code, and I take it very seriously. That means that I will exercise a great deal of trust when I give you individual assignments, and that I will come down hard on violations of that trust. 

*All work submitted in this class must include a written reaffirmation of the CU honor code*.
