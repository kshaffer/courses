## Syllabus 

Music is an art. Music is a language. Music is therapy. Music is [a clinical tool](http://www.musictherapy.org). Music is a [weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations). Music is an area of humanistic inquiry. Music is math. Music is neuroscience. Music is communal. Music is deeply personal. Music is [bug spray](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/13/entertainment/ca-musichurts13). Music is religion. Music is [identity formation](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3505052W/Music_in_Everyday_Life). Music is culture. Music is psychology.

Music is nearly unparalleled in its ability to engage just about every facet of our lives. Perhaps only language has the same reach into our biology, psychology, individual identity, and social community. Music both frames, and is dependent on, our memory. Music both affects and flows from our emotions. Music both embodies and transcends cultural prejudice. And despite its heavily scientific base, even professional musicians treat it with an air of mystery.

One goal of the music theory course sequence is to demistify musical structure, to help you as current and aspiring professional musicians understand the ways in which a variety of types of music are constructed, and what meanings can be attached to those structures.

But since music is a social art, learning about musical structure is almost useless if we don't learn how to communicate our insights about musical structure — especially to the non-experts who will comprise our audiences, patrons, students, and employers.

Thus the goal for this course is twofold: to continue to learn about musical structure and its meaning in new contexts, and to develop the skill of written communication about music using a variety of means.

## The music

This semester, we will engage music in two genres: *German Lieder* (art songs from the "Romantic" period — roughly the nineteenth century) and *post-tonal music* of the twentieth (and possibly twenty-first) century. Much of this music will be attached to a text, a painting, a ballet, or other non-musical art and information. Thus, our study of this music will go beyond notes, rhythms, chords, etc., and we will explore the relationship between these structural elements of the music and the textual/visual/physical elements of these artworks, as well.

## The coursework

Coursework this semester will come in several forms. In-class activities will be mostly ungraded and will include small- and large-group discussions, musical analysis, instructor demonstrations and lectures, and occasional quizzes. Out-of-class activities will primarily include reading and private exploration of pieces of music in preparation for class activities, and written work. Assessed writing in this class will take five forms: Twitter essays, blog posts, comments on colleagues' blog posts, Wikipedia edits, and academic papers. Details on each are provided on [Writing assignments for Semester 4 Theory](mt4-writing.html).

## Typical weekly schedule

### First meeting (Monday/Tuesday)

Prepare for class with one or more of the following:

- a reading  
- a piece of music to explore  
- questions to answer in light of the reading/piece in advance of an in-class quiz  
- Twitter essay due (4–5 students)  
- blog post due (3–4 students)  
- blog post revisions due (3–4 students)  

In-class activities:

- evaluate Twitter essays  
- short electronic quiz based on assigned reading/music  
- discussion and/or analytical work  
- possibly a short lecture  

### Second meeting (Wednesday/Thursday)

Prepare for class with one or more of the following:

- follow-up analysis from Monday/Tuesday's activity  
- read any class blog posts published on Monday  
- blog comments due (9–12 students)  
- Wikipedia edits due (1 group of 4–5 students)  
- Twitter essay due (4–5 students)  

In-class activities:

- evaluate Twitter essays  
- Wikipedia editing group presentation  
- discussion and/or analytical work  
- possibly a short lecture  

## Assessment

Students will receive letter grades for three categories: *Lieder*, *Post-Tonal Music*, and *Writing*. 

*Lieder* and *Post-tonal* categories will be determined by students demonstrating analytical ability in reference to the following musical elements in each style. Demonstrating that ability *in two or more quizzes or writing assignments* will constitute passing.

- pitch structures (melody, harmony, motives, sets, rows, etc.)  
- rhythmic & metric structures  
- formal structures  
- "secondary" parameters (dynamics, articulation, orchstration, register, etc.)  
- relationship of musical structure to extramusical elements (text, dance, liturgical significance, historical context, etc.)

Passing 5 of these elements will constitute an A for the category, 4 a B, 3 a C, 2 a D, 0–1 an F.

The *writing* category grade will be determined by the number of written assignments passed (see [writing assignments page](mt4-writing.html) for passing standards) by their respective deadlines. Students are asked to write 3 Twitter essays, 1 blog post, 1 academic paper, 2 group Wikipedia edits, and comments on 3 classmates' blog posts: total of 10 written assignments.

Writing grades are determined as follows:

- A: 10 assignments passed  
- A–: 9 assignments passed  
- B: 8 assignments passed  
- B–: 7 assignments passed  
- C: 6 assignments passed  
- C–: 5 assignments passed  
- D: 4 assignments passed  
- D–: 3 assignments passed  
- F: 0–2 assignments passed

Graded work will come in two forms: 

- brief in-class quizzes (open-note, usually with questions distributed in advance)  
- [writing assignments](mt4-writing.html)

Each quiz and writing assignment will provide students opportunity to demonstrate mastery of one or more (usually more) of the assessment objectives.

**A student's overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of all unit grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest unit grade — whichever is lower.**

Examples:

To receive a final grade of A, a student needs a median grade of A for the three unit grades, and nothing lower than a B. So A A A, or A A B for the three unit grades would resuli in a final grade of A.

To receive a final grade of B, a student needs a median unit grade of B, and nothing lower than a C. So unit grades of A B B, A B C, B B B, or B B C would result in a final grade of B.
