## Syllabus 

Music is an art. Music is a language. Music is therapy. Music is [a clinical tool](http://www.musictherapy.org). Music is a [weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations). Music is an area of humanistic inquiry. Music is math. Music is neuroscience. Music is communal. Music is deeply personal. Music is [bug spray](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/13/entertainment/ca-musichurts13). Music is religion. Music is [identity formation](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3505052W/Music_in_Everyday_Life). Music is culture. Music is psychology.

Music is nearly unparalleled in its ability to engage just about every facet of our lives. Perhaps only language has the same reach into our biology, psychology, individual identity, and social community. Music both frames, and is dependent on, our memory. Music both affects and flows from our emotions. Music both embodies and transcends cultural prejudice. And despite its heavily scientific base, even professional musicians treat it with an air of mystery.

One goal of the music theory course sequence is to demistify musical structure, to help you as current and aspiring professional musicians understand the ways in which a variety of types of music are constructed, and what meanings can be attached to those structures.

But since music is a social art, learning about musical structure is almost useless if we don't learn how to communicate our insights about musical structure — especially to the non-experts who will comprise our audiences, patrons, students, and employers.

Thus the goal for this course is twofold: to continue to learn about musical structure and its meaning in new contexts, and to develop the skill of written communication about music using a variety of means.

## The music

This semester, we will engage music in two genres: *German Lieder* (art songs from the "Romantic" period — roughly the nineteenth century) and *post-tonal music* of the twentieth (and possibly twenty-first) century. Much of this music will be attached to a text, a painting, a ballet, or other non-musical art and information. Thus, our study of this music will go beyond notes, rhythms, chords, etc., and we will explore the relationship between these structural elements of the music and the textual/visual/physical elements of these artworks, as well.

## The coursework

Coursework this semester will come in several forms. In-class activities will be mostly ungraded and will include small- and large-group discussions, musical analysis, instructor demonstrations and lectures, and occasional quizzes. Out-of-class activities will primarily include reading and private exploration of pieces of music in preparation for class activities, and written work. Assessed writing in this class will take five forms: Twitter essays, blog posts, comments on colleagues' blog posts, Wikipedia edits, and academic papers. Details on each are provided below.

### Twitter essays

Each student will write three Twitter essays over the course of the semester. Dates will be assigned by the instructor, with a few students writing in advance of each class. Please do the following when writing your essay:

1. Read Jesse Stommel's article, [The Twitter Essay](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/the-twitter-essay/).   
2. Formulate a concise, novel insight about a poem or piece of music we have recently studied.  
3. Compose an essay of exactly 140 characters, including the hashtag #TwitterEssay and either #Lieder or #PostTonal (depending on the genre you are writing about). As Jesse says, "Play, innovate, incite." It can look like the thesis statement for a longer essay. But try to do something more, or at least more interesting. Push the (very limited) boundaries of the genre you are using.  
4. Submit your Twitter essay to [this online form](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/forms/d/1nPLg1MHnWkylbb7KIDYbm9tCg_YrtPeSpe24Pyvl9vE/viewform?usp=send_form). 

Jesse's article contains some examples. You can also [search Twitter for examples](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TwitterEssay&src=typd). (Note that not all of these results follow Jesse's rubric. There are many kinds of Twitter essays.)  

Each class will begin with a discussion of the Twitter essays composed for that day. The class will vote anonymously on whether or not a Twitter essay merits publication on the class Twitter account. If two-thirds or more of the class vote yes, the tweet will be published. If not, we will work as a class to improve it to reach publishability. The author of the essay will have the final say in any improvements. At the end of a brief discussion, we will vote again. If it still does not pass, or if the author decides to take extra time to work on it, the author will have until the next class to improve it. If it does not pass two-thirds approval on the second attempt, no credit will be given for the essay.

### Blog posts

Each student will write one blog post of about 500 words (about two typed, double-spaced pages). Each week, a handful of students (or less) will write a blog post. Dates will be assigned by the instructor.

Like the Twitter essays, blog posts will engage a text, piece of music, or musical concept recently discussed in class. Blog posts should be aimed at a non-specialist audience — either non-musicians or at least practicing musicians who have not studied music theory formally.

When writing blog posts, do the following:

1. Read Jesse Stommel's blog post, ["What is Good Writing?: A Meditation on Breaking Rules and Grammar Pedagogy"](http://learning.instructure.com/2014/06/what-is-good-writing-a-meditation-on-breaking-rules-and-grammar-pedagogy/).  
2. Formulate a concise, novel insight about a poem, piece of music, or musical concept we have recently studied.  
3. Gather supporting data/evidence in support of that insight.  
4. Compose a blog post that explains your insight using some or all of your supporting evidence.  
5. Write in clear prose that is generally gramatically correct and logically organized. However, you must also *break at least one rule* of good writing that you have learned in the past, or *use at least one novel feature of web-based writing that is unavailable in print*. Do so in the service of communicating your insight more effectively. For example, you can embed a Spotify audio track or a YouTube video. You can alternate between normal and backwards/upside-down text to make a point about symmetry in the musical structure. Incomplete sentences. (See what I did there?) Mixing languages. Something that pushes the boundaries of traditional writing in the way that the poets and composers we discuss push the boundaries of poetic and musical structure.  
6. Write your blog post in a Google Doc.  
7. Share the Google Doc with kris.shaffer@colorado.edu.  
8. Copy and paste the document's sharing link [on this form](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/forms/d/12WTuz0BdPyfmLnJb5O3bjpehE2QIc7HHZCgoGa8BsX4/viewform?usp=send_form).
