### Unit topics ###

This course will focus on the normative harmonic, melodic, and formal structures of multiple musical styles, with a view towards understanding both the *general* traits that underly most of Western tonal and post-tonal music, and the *specific* traits that are typical of two specific styles of Western tonal music. In order to accomplish this, the course will be divided into three units, each covering a single style of music:

- Unit I: Classical form (themes and sonatas)  
- Unit II: Introduction to post-tonal music  
- Unit III: Pop/rock form  

More details are provided in the three unit guides.

### Assessment ###

Each student will receive a single letter grade for each unit, based on the number of musical concepts a student has mastered by the unit deadline. Those musical concepts are listed in each unit's guide (see above). Generally, students will be given at least two opportunities during each unit to demonstrate mastery of each concept, and only their performance on the *most recent* assessment attempt will count towards the unit grade. More details are provided in the unit guides.

A student's overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of all unit grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest unit grade—whichever is lower.

### Reassessment ###

In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts *within two weeks* of the unit deadline. One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window.

The reassessment must be *completed* within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor *immediately* to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.
