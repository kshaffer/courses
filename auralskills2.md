### Musical concepts and fluency ###

The goal of this course sequence is musical fluency: that is, the successful depositing of musical information into readily-accessible long-term memory, and the successful cognitive assimilation of musical concepts and structures.
We will seek an advanced level of fluency in diatonic tonal music (no chromaticism or modulation), and an introductory level of fluency with chromatic elements in a tonal context.

### Assessment ###

Assessment will be performed in reference to three categories of musical skills and concepts: 

- *rhythm*  
- *melodic pitch elements*  
- *harmonic pitch elements*  

Each category contains between 9 and 15 specific concepts or skills, outlined in the [course assessment guide]({{ root_url }}/as2-assess.html). A student’s letter grade for a given category is determined by the number of those specific concepts or skills for which the student demonstrates mastery by the end of the appropriate unit of study. 

A student's overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of the three category grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest category grade—whichever is lower.

In-class and out-of-class activities will be designed to help students develop those concepts/skills and to assess progress toward those end-of-unit goals.

### Reassessment ###

In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts *within two weeks* of the unit deadline. One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window.

The reassessment must be *completed* within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor *immediately* to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.
