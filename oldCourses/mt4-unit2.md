# Unit II: Introduction to post-tonal music #

The goal of this unit is to provide an introduction to post-tonal Western art music. It will be largely repertoire-driven (focusing on pieces of music), and will last four weeks (through Spring Break).

We will focus on two goals selected by the class on our survey:

- The ability to articulate with detail and nuance how a piece of atonal music is constructed and what it means.  
- Using the study of post-tonal music in a way that helps open minds to other kinds of non-classical, non-tonal, or non-Western music.

The repertoire focus of this unit will primarily be select works of Bela Bartók, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky.

## Concepts ##

Our study will be geared towards the goal of being able to understand and explain the following in respect to a specific piece of atonal music.

- Primary parameters (pitch and/or rhythm)  
- Secondary parameters (timbre, orchestration, dynamics, tempo, etc.) and/or text, if applicable  
- Large-scale formal structure  
- Construction of a single analytical thesis (in other words, tying it all together with a single analytical or interpretive claim)  
- Basic knowledge of post-tonal analytical tools

Because of the use of "one-of-a-kind forms," these concepts play out differently in each piece. As a result, only the last (post-tonal tools) will be assessed on quizzes. The rest will be assessed according to one of the following two models. Each student can choose which model to follow. If a student chooses Model 2 (daily/weekly responses), he or she can choose at any time to switch to Model 1 (end-of-unit paper/presentation). Students who choose Model 1 *cannot* switch to Model 2.

### Model 1 – end-of-unit paper/presentation ###

Under this model, students will be assessed according to a short written paper or video presentation due at the end of the unit (in addition to the quizzes on post-tonal tools). Analyses will be assessed according to the five criteria listed above.

The number of these criteria that a student meets in a paper/presentation for a piece not discussed in class will be the grade for this category. (5 = A, 4 = B, . . . 0 = F)

The number of these criteria that a student meets in a paper/presentation minus 1 for a piece discussed in class will be the grade for this category. (5 = B, 4 = C . . . 0 or 1 = F)

### Model 2 – daily/weekly responses ###

For each piece covered in class, students will follow class discussion/analysis with a single-paragraph response explaining some aspect(s) of the structure and meaning of the piece in their own words. (This is also an opportunity to ask specific questions about the pieces privately that were not discussed in class time.) Instructor or grader will respond (usually) within two days with comments, answers to questions, and assessments, to which students are encouraged to respond. Analytical writings will be assessed according to the five criteria listed above.

Instructor or grader will provide assessment for each criterion at the bottom of the Google Doc, to help students keep track of which areas of musical analysis they are excelling in and which need closer attention. These will be rolling assessments, meaning that like the quizzes in Unit I, it is the overall or most recent performance that will be "counted."

The number of these criteria for which a student has demonstrated mastery by the end of the unit will be the grade for this category. (5 = A, 4 = B, . . . 0 = F)
