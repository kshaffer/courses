Students wishing to pursue an A or a B for Unit I must submit a video of a prepared performance of a pop/rock song by **8am on Monday, October 13.** Three different project options are listed below, with both individual and collaborative options provided. ***All performances must be of songs in the Aural Skills 3 transcription repertoire.*** (This will be added to Google Drive and shared with all students once final transcriptions start arriving.)

Students must successfully complete the transcription project in order to be eligible for the performance project. Successful completion of the performance project will fulfill the contract requirements for a B for the unit and make the student eligible for the A-level sight-reading assessment.

Any of the following three options will fulfill the requirements of this project.

## Option 1: solo keyboard performance

Make a video of yourself performing a song in the repertoire. The performance must include the following three elements *performed simultaneously*:

- **melody** (sung—lyrics or solfège) – be sure to sing any instrumental melodies that occur during vocal breaks during the song.  
- **bass line** in the left hand – the actual instrumental bass line (not simply the lowest note of each chord)  
- **block chords** in the right hand – arpeggios or rhythmicized chords are fine as well, but block chords are the minimum, one per lead-sheet symbol. (Rearticulate downbeats for chords that last more than one bar.) A root-position, closed-position triad is fine.

You are encouraged to practice and re-record yourself until you have a (nearly) flawless performance on video. Then submit according to the instructions below.

## Option 2: solo multitrack performance

Make a multitrack audio recording of yourself performing all of the following (same list as required transcription elements):

- all vocal parts  
- all instrumental lines
- bass line  
- block chords – arpeggios or rhythmicized chords are fine as well, but block chords are the minimum, one per lead-sheet symbol. (Rearticulate downbeats for chords that last more than one bar.) A root-position, closed-position triad is fine.

Start by recording one of the above parts. Then use software such as Audacity, GarageBand, ProTools, etc. to record audio of your performance of the other elements of the transcription as new layers. When finished, export a single audio file (decent-quality mp3 or aac is fine) of your combined "performance."

These parts can be sung/played on any instrument you like. While you are free to change the register to adapt them to your playability, try to keep your "arrangement" musical (bass on the bottom, melody on the top, or at least slightly louder than the other voices).

You are encouraged to practice and re-record yourself until you have a (nearly) flawless performance. (Slight variations in tempo or tuning between the different tracks are okay.) Then submit according to the instructions below.

## Option 3: group performance

Form a group of 3–5 people. For *each transcription made by your group members*:

- Decide on a shortened version of the song that includes at least one complete cycle (such as verse–prechorus–chorus) and all other modules in the song. For example, for a verse-chorus song with a prechorus and a bridge, you could perform **I V P C B C O.**  
- Assign parts to the group members. The minimum set of parts should include melody, bass line, and block chords. Groups with four or five members can add (or, if necessary, double) parts for other members.  
- The transcriber of each song should lead rehearsal for that song.  
- Record a video performance of the song as an ensemble.

You are encouraged to practice and re-record yourself until you have a (nearly) flawless performance. Then submit ***videos of all songs*** according to the instructions below.


## Deadline

Performance submissions are due at the end of Unit I: **8am on Monday, October 13.** Early submissions will be accepted, but not late submissions. On-time submissions that are not up to standard are subject to the reassessment policy (see [syllabus](auralskills3.html)). There is no *re*assessment of work not submitted before the unit deadline.

## Submission instructions

When you are ready to submit, upload *two* files to your CU Google Drive account: the score (PDF) and the audio/video performance. (If your notation application does not support PDF creation, Mac OS X—and maybe Windows?—supports *printing* to PDF. Simply begin the print process, but before clicking "OK" click "PDF" for options.) Make sure both files are named "LASTNAME - Title of song (performance)". If collaborating, make sure all names are in the file name. 

Then share both files with kris.shaffer@colorado.edu. See [this short video](https://vimeo.com/73001492) for uploading/sharing instructions if you are new to Google Drive. Make sure you share it from your CU Google Apps account.
