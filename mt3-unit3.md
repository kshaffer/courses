# Unit III: Sonata theory #

Unit III will cover classical sonata structures. We will review and build on the work you did on musical form in Units I and II, as well as introduce and go into depth on the normative structures of sonata-form movements.

The overall goal for this unit is for all students to be able to identify the key structural elements of standard classical theme forms (phrases, sentences, periods, hybrid themes, and compound themes) and the key structural elements of sonata form in a classical sonata movement, as well as to comunicate verbally, in detail and with nuance, about those structures in classical pieces of moderate analytical difficulty.

## Materials ##

We will be following the theories of [James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4294182W/Elements_of_sonata_theory) for our study of sonata form. If you would like to study their theories in greater detail, or look up supplemental examples of what we engage in class, check out that book link. However, all required material for this unit will be posted on here, most of which comes from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com) website:

### Assessments ###

[Sonata assessment 1 (due Dec. 1)](mt3-sonataAssess1.html)  

## Concepts ##

Our coursework in this unit will be directed towards to goal of consistent, correct identification and interpretation of the following concepts or structural elements in the context of classical-era pieces. Read as "I can identify and interpret . . ."

- Exposition and recapitulation types (continuous, two-part, two-part with multiple MCs)  
- Structural points of arrival (medial caesura, essential expositional closure, essential sonata closure, crux)  
- Theme-level modules (primary, transition, secondary, closing, TR=>FS, retransition)  
- Movement-level modules (exposition, development, recapitulation, introduction, coda)  
- Nuanced response to complex analytical situations

## Assessment ##

You will receive at least two assessment opportunities for each concept (except the last one) during the unit. For each assessment, you will receive one of the following marks for each concept: **P – passing**, **A - attempted**, or **N – not attempted**. 

Your unit grade will take into account only your mark for the *most recent assessment* that covered a given concept. If you do not take an assessment, your marks from the previous assessment will be taken.

Unit letter grades will be determined by the number of concepts you have passed by the final assessment:

- A: 5 concepts passing  
- B: 4 concepts passing  
- C: 3 concepts passing  
- D: 2 concepts passing  
- F: 1 or fewer concepts passing

## End-of-unit project ##

Regular assessments will cover the first four concepts. An end-of-unit project will cover the fifth (nuanced interpretation) and provide a reassessment opportunity for those who need one. You may choose from either of the following two projects. However, note that Option 1 will only provide an opportunity to demonstrate nuanced interpretation. If any of the four nuts-and-bolts concepts are not passed, you should do Option 2 in order to reassess.

Of course, if you are happy with your unit (and therefore semester) grade after the last regular assessment, you are free to skip the final project.

All end-of-unit projects must be received by **Tuesday, December 16, 8am.** Upload your materials to Google Drive and share them with kris.shaffer@colorado.edu by that time.

### Option 1

I will provide two different analyses of a single, relatively ambiguous sonata movement. Write a short paper (800 words maximum), produce a short video (5 minutes maximum), or sign up for a 15-minute oral exam. In your paper/video/exam, explain in detail which analysis you think makes more musical sense and why. You are also free to pick and choose elements from each analysis that you prefer.

### Option 2

Please do the following: 

- Find a sonata-form movement with complex or ambiguous features.  
- Produce a timeline (paper or digital) accurately labeling all 4 conceptual elements in that movement.  
- Write a short paper (800 words maximum) or produce a short video (5 minutes maximum), produce a short video (5 minutes maximum), or sign up for a 15-minute oral exam. In your paper/video/exam, explain ambiguous elements in the movement—either the thought process that went into choosing the labels you chose on your timeline for ambiguous passages, or explaining the musical significance of complex elements that resisted clear timeline labels.
