# Assessment guide #

Coursework will be divided into four units, or cycles, ending in weeks 3, 7, 11, and 15.

Assessment will be performed in reference to three categories of musical skills and concepts: 

- *rhythm*  
- *melodic pitch elements*  
- *harmonic pitch elements*  

Each category contains between 10 and 16 specific concepts or skills. At any point in the semester, for each concept/skill, students will have a current mark of **N – not attempted**, **A – attempted**, or **P – passed**. A student's letter grade for a given category will be determined by the number of concepts/skills s/he has mastered (grade of P) by the end of the unit, by percentage (90/80/70/60). *Only the most recent assessment attempt(s) will count toward the letter grade.*

See [syllabus]({{ root_url }}/auralskills2.html) for final grade and reassessment information.

The concepts/skills for each category are listed below, followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). The concept/skills are also listed according to unit deadline. Assessment opportunities for these concepts/skills will take place in the units listed, but possibly in earlier units as well.
