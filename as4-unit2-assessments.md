## Assessment activities

There are two assessment categories this unit: *post-tonal pitch materials* and *advanced rhythm and meter*. For each learning objective, I have outlined below the assessment standard for passing the objective, the kinds of tasks that we will use for assessment, and the kinds of tasks that we will use for building the skill.

### Post-tonal pitch materials

- recognize common modes and cells in a musical passage by ear – pass 1 quiz  
- transcribe music making use of common modes and cells (no instrument or time constraints) – pass 2 take-home transcription assignments  
- perform common modes and cells in isolation (sung) – create 1 video portfolio  
- perform music that makes use of common modes and cells with preparation (instrument of choice) – pass 1 video performance
perform music that makes use of common modes and cells from sight (instrument of choice) – pass 1 sight-reading exam

### Advanced rhythm and meter

- recognize common asymmetrical meters in a passage by ear (quintuple, septuple, changing, “asymmetrical compound”) – pass 1 quiz  
- transcribe the rhythm of a melody/passage in a common asymmetrical meter – pass 2 take-home transcription assignments  
- perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters in a real piece of music with preparation (instrument of choice) – pass 1 video performance  
- perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters in a real piece of music from sight (instrument of choice) – pass 1 sight-reading exam

## Assessment standards

### Post-tonal pitch materials

*Recognize modes by ear.* We will have approx. 3 short quizzes, each containing 4–5 musical excerpts 20–30 seconds in length that are each (predominantly, if not completely) governed by a collection on the video portfolio list. You will hear each excerpt twice with time in between each hearing. Write down the name of the collection type you hear (octatonic, pentatonic, lydian, dorian, etc.). Correct discernment of all collections, or all but one, will pass. Each student must pass one quiz attempt to meet the assessment objective.

*Transcribe music using common modes and cells.* We will have at least four take-home transcription assignments involving short passages, typically for keyboard. (On some occasions, the same transcription will cover both pitch and rhythm transcription objectives.) These will be approximately the same length as the melodic and four-part transcriptions from Unit I, but what you will transcribe will be less complex than the four-part passages. The materials to transcribe will be provided, along with a starting pitch. (For simple textures, such as two voices on the keyboard, you will transcribe everything. For denser textures, you will be directed to a particular melody or instrument to transcribe.) Transcribe the passage as best you can, using an instrument if you like (highly recommended). Transcriptions that are accurate (or very close) in their pitch content will pass this objective. Each student must pass two take-home transcriptions to meet the assessment objective.

*Perform common modes in isolation.* Create a video portfolio according to the instructions on [this page](materials/as4-unit2modeVideos.html). One video portfolio with all performances correct or very close will meet this assessment objective.

*Perform music that makes use of common modes and cells (prepared).* You will be given a musical excerpt from the literature to perform on your instrument of choice. Record yourself on video, and submit your performance according to the procedure given to you by your instructor. Practice and record as many takes as you like, and submit the best. One recorded performance that is accurate, or very close, will meet this assessment objective.

*Perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters in a real piece of music (from sight).* We will have two sight-reading exams in Weeks 14 and 15. In these exams, you will be given the choice of three melodies: 1) a melody with standard rhythm but pitch material based on one of the post-tonal collections on our list, 2) a melody with “advanced” rhythm/meter but is in a non-modulating major or minor key, and 3) a melody that contains both advanced rhythm/meter and pitch material based on one of our post-tonal collections. Your choice will determine the assessment objective (pitch, rhythm/meter, or both). To pass the exam, you will perform the melody accurately (or nearly so) in no more than two attempts during a 5-minute exam. *Both pitch and rhythm must be accurate to pass*, no matter what objective(s) you are attempting. Passing one sight-reading exam will meet this assessment objective.


### Advanced rhythm and meter

*Recognize common asymmetrical meters by ear.* We will have approx. three quizzes on meter. You will hear 4–5 passages on each quiz, and then will have to identify the meter (e.g., simple septuple, compound quintuple, asymmetrical compound duple, etc.). If the meter is asymmetrical, also identify the beat/division breakdown (2+2+3, 3+2, etc.). Correct discernment of all meters, or all but one, will pass. (Note that some excerpts will have multiple acceptable answers.) Each student must pass one quiz attempt to meet the assessment objective.

*Transcribe the rhythm of a melody/passage in a common asymmetrical meter.* We will have at least four take-home transcription assignments involving short passages, typically for keyboard. (On some occasions, the same transcription will cover both pitch and rhythm transcription objectives.) These will be approximately the same length as the melodic and four-part transcriptions from Unit I, but what you will transcribe will be less complex than the four-part passages. The materials to transcribe will be provided, along with a starting pitch. (For simple textures, such as two voices on the keyboard, you will transcribe everything. For denser textures, you will be directed to a particular melody or instrument to transcribe.) Transcribe the passage as best you can, using an instrument if you like (highly recommended). Transcriptions that are accurate (or very close) in their meter and their rhythmic content will pass this objective. Each student must pass two take-home transcriptions to meet the assessment objective.

*Perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters in a real piece of music (prepared).* You will be given a musical excerpt from the literature to perform on your instrument of choice. Record yourself on video, and submit your performance according to the procedure given to you by your instructor. Practice and record as many takes as you like, and submit the best. One recorded performance that is accurate, or very close, will meet this assessment objective.

*Perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters in a real piece of music (from sight).* We will have two sight-reading exams in Weeks 14 and 15. In these exams, you will be given the choice of three melodies: 1) a melody with standard rhythm but pitch material based on one of the post-tonal collections on our list, 2) a melody with “advanced” rhythm/meter but is in a non-modulating major or minor key, and 3) a melody that contains both advanced rhythm/meter and pitch material based on one of our post-tonal collections. Your choice will determine the assessment objective (pitch, rhythm/meter, or both). To pass the exam, you will perform the melody accurately (or nearly so) in no more than two attempts during a 5-minute exam. *Both pitch and rhythm must be accurate to pass*, no matter what objective(s) you are attempting. Passing one sight-reading exam will meet this assessment objective.


## Practice and skill development activities

**Prepared in-class performance:** The goal of perpared in-class performance is the fusing of visual (score), sonic, and physical (sung/played) aspects of a musical concept. Thus, accurate performance and *instant (aural) feedback when incorrect* is necessary. We will pursue both accuracy and quick feedback through our performance work together.

**In-class sight-reading:** The goals of practicing sight-reading as a group are 1) learning how to analyze pitch/rhythmic structures visually, without playing or hearing, and 2) increasing our ability to perform those structures accurately.

**Small-group practice transcriptions (and listening quizzes):** This has the same goal as prepared performance: the fusing of visual (score), sonic, and physical (sung/played) aspects of a musical concept. Thus, quick feedback when wrong (from each other and from the instructor) and an opportunity to ask questions when you cannot come to a correct consensus are important.

**Think – pair – share:** This is a more formal version of small-group practice. Your instructor will give you a musical example (like you'll hear on the quizzes), and each of you will write down your answer (the meter or collection you hear, for example). Then you will compare answers with one other person (and debate/persuade as necessary), and then discuss as a whole class. Before moving on, the instructor will confirm the correct answer and answer conceptual questions before continuing.
