# Unit II: Classical-era transcription and improvisation #

Unit II will comprise an in-depth study of the fast transcription and the improvisation of short passages in the style of classical-era instrumental music. The goal is both to build fluent knowledge of the structural elements of this style and to build facility with the tasks of transcription and improvisation.

## Materials ##

This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.



## Concepts and assessment ##

The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the [syllabus]({{ root_url }}/auralskills3.html)) are divided into two categories: *classical transcription* and *classical improvisation*. They are listed below, followed by assessment criteria. Read all concept/skill objectives as "I can . . ."

**Classical transcription (Unit II)**

- Transcribe the melody of a classical-style instrumental theme.  
- Transcribe the harmonic progression of a classical-style instrumental theme.  
- Transcribe the formal structure (phrases, sub-phrases, theme structure) of a classical-style instrumental theme.  
- Recognize by ear the *galant* schemata of a classical-style instrumental theme.  

Assessment tasks will include multiple classical themes or phrases. Each assessment will receive four marks of N/A/P, corresponding to these four objectives. Perfect or near-perfect accuracy is required for a mark of P. Assessments will take place in-class and will involve *two hearings* for each passage. Half-credit will be given for objectives that are completed outside of class and/or with the assistance of an instrument or software.

Overall grades for each assessment will be assigned as follows:

- A: 4 objectives met  
- B+: 3.5 objectives met  
- B: 3 objectives met  
- C+: 2.5 objectives met  
- C: 2 objectives met  
- D+: 1.5 objective met  
- D: 1 objective met  
- F: 0 or 0.5 objectives met

The end-of-unit grade for this category will be the average of the highest two of the last three assessments performed. There will be no live (full credit) reassessments for this category during finals week, only take-home (half-credit) reassessments.

**Classical improvisation (Unit II)**

Students will be assessed for their ability to perform an improvised melody on any instrument (or voice) they choose that is idiomatic to the classical instrumental style. Students will be given a formal scheme (sentence, period, or hybrid theme), a harmonic progression (typically 1–2 chords per bar), and (optionally) *galant* schemata to reflect in the melody.

In improvisation assessments, students will be allowed to choose both the instrument and the level of difficulty for the melody they improvise. The highest level of difficulty successfully performed during the unit will determine the unit grade for this objective. Students will be allowed at least two assessment attempts (and one reassessment during finals week). Additional attempts are at the discretion of the instructor/TA.

- Improvise a classical-style melody with 1–2 chord tones per chord/stage (D level)  
- Improvise a classical-style melody with 3 or more chord tones per chord/stage (C level)  
- Improvise a classical-style melody with multiple properly treated diatonic non-chord tones (B level)  
- Improvise a classical-style melody with multiple properly treated chromatic non-chord tones (A level)
