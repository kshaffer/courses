# Unit III: Strict composition in four voices

When we engage music as listeners, composers, performers, scholars, our brains generate expectations about notes, chords, melodies, chord progressions, instrumentation, large-scale form, etc. Some of these expectations are hard-wired and naturally selected, others are learned in the course of our individual lives. All of them shape the way we experience music. And all of them are in competition with each other.

Strict composition is a musical activity that helps us begin to learn how to mediate these conflicts, in order to produce a musical whole that both challenges and pleases the listener. Its most direct application is in "free" composition (composing music in real styles, as opposed to "strict" styles for the purposes of learning). However, the principles we explore in strict composition will help us better understand the music we perform and teach, which will in turn help us to perform, arrange, critique, and teach it in more musically mature ways.

## Concepts and assessment

*Strict voice-leading in four parts* concepts (keyboard style), due at the end of Unit III (again, major and minor versions each count as their own concept for final-grade purposes):

- **basso continuo** – realize (notate and perform—video) a figured bass line in four-part, *basso continuo* keyboard style. No partner. One realization in major, one in minor.  
- **melodic keyboard style** – realize (notate and perform—video) a figured bass line in four-part, *melodic* keyboard style. No partner. One realization in major, one in minor.  

*Theoretical thinking* objectives for the semester (each of the four count as a concept for final-grade purposes):

- Choose four voice-leading principles (two from strict two-voice composition, two from strict four-voice composition). For each one, write no more than a paragraph (in a Google document, not a Word/Pages/PDF file, please) *or* create a video of no more than 1.5 minutes, explaining how that principle relates to one or more concepts of music perception and cognition, and compare/contrast that relationship to a pattern/rule/principle in a free musical style (classical keyboard, opera, choral, pop/rock, etc.). As a third option, you may sign up for a 15-minute oral exam appointment in which to explain all four, rather than submit four documents/videos.

## Fundamentals reassessments

If after Thursday's class, Dec. 11, you have attempted but not passed one of the chordal fundamentals categories (triad ID/writing, seventh-chord ID/writing, Roman numerals), you may make videos in which to explain the not-yet-passed concept(s).

TRIADS: If either of the triad concepts is not passing (ID and/or writing), make a 2-minute "triads" video in which you explain the four triad qualities in terms of their interval content and/or common scale-degree/solfège associations. Use an example of each quality type, and make sure that at least one example has a natural root, at least one has a sharp root, at least one has a flat root. At least one of your examples should be inverted. Use an instrument to play these examples as your explain them.

SEVENTH CHORDS: If either of the seventh-chord concepts is not passing (ID and/or writing), make a 2-minute "seventh-chords" video in which you explain the five seventh-chord qualities in terms of their interval content and/or common scale-degree/solfège associations. Use an example of each quality type, and make sure that at least one example has a natural root, at least one has a sharp root, at least one has a flat root. At least two of your examples should be inverted. Use an instrument to play these examples as your explain them.

ROMAN NUMERALS: If you are not passing the Roman numerals concept, make a 2-minute video explaining the concept of Roman numeral designation. What aspects of a chord does a Roman numeral signify? How do you determine the Roman numeral of a particular chord? Give at least four examples, played at an instrument. Be sure to have a mixture of chord qualities, roots, and major/minor keys in your examples.
