## Course description

This course examines theoretical approaches to social change while students design alternative media strategies for their Masters’ project. Students also analyze the tactical potentials of various media including smart phones, podcasting, video gaming and flash mob activism. This participatory and discussion-oriented course explores the politics of media activism: its tactics, its strategies and its goals. The course relies on both a survey of the existing theory and scholarship on media activism, as well as close analyses of actual activist practices within both old and new media and on a local, national and global scale. Special attention will be paid to questions of creativity and efficacy, addressing questions concerning the value of media activism as both an aesthetic and political activity.

## Overview

When announcing that there would be no indictment of Darren Wilson after the shooting of Michael Brown, St. Louis prosecutor Bob McCulloch stated:

> The most significant challenge encountered in this investigation has been the 24-hour news cycle and its insatiable appetite for something, for anything to talk about, following closely behind with the non-stop rumors on social media.

Protest leader Deray McKesson responded on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>McCulloch takes another dig at social media. But were it not for Twitter, he would&#39;ve convinced the world that we didn&#39;t exist. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ferguson?src=hash">#Ferguson</a></p>&mdash; deray mckesson (@deray) <a href="https://twitter.com/deray/status/537068182909882368">November 25, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Social and independent media have become cornerstones of (anti-)social activist movements in the twenty-first century. Arab Spring, #GamerGate (both sides), Ferguson, #BlackLivesMatter, #BlueLivesMatter — all have relied on social media to accomplish their purposes. @deray, @Nettaaaaaaaa, and @tefpoe used Twitter to organize protests around St. Louis and to warn activists of police presense and activity. Protesters used Twitter, Instagram, and Vine to document alleged police brutality, and to "cover" events outside the police-imposed press pen. 

The decentralized nature of these social media empower groups and individuals to get messages out fast, bypassing mainstream media outlets. They also allow for, perhaps even require, a different kind of activist leadership. This led to criticism from figures like Oprah Winfrey [calling for more leadership from the movement](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/protesters-slam-oprah-suggesting-movement-lacks-leadership) — a centralized voice. But as activist responses (on Twitter, of course) made clear, the movement does have leadership, but leadership of a different kind.

Shaun King's response to Oprah was telling:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I love <a href="https://twitter.com/Oprah">@Oprah</a>. Was an Oprah Scholar <a href="https://twitter.com/Morehouse">@Morehouse</a>. Her quote suggests 1 thing...&#10;&#10;All she learned about Ferguson came from the nightly news.</p>&mdash; Shaun King (@ShaunKing) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/551109555040829440">January 2, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The accusation was not that Oprah was wrong, but that Oprah had the wrong information. That she doesn't understand the media being used by the movement, and the difference in how the movement organizes around those media.

To understand activism means, in part, to understand the media being used by the activists. 

In this class, we will explore the technology behind contemporary social media, the uses to which social media are put in a variety of settings, and we will use some of those media to document a movement or an event chosen by the class. Where possible, we will interview scholars, journalists, and activists who use these media successfully in their work.

## Schedule

### Unit I: Activist media in theory and at work

In this unit, comprising roughly Weeks 1–9 of the semester, students will engage public scholars, journalists, and activists who are using new media in their work. When possible, we will interview these individuals as part of class. The beginning of the unit will explore the theoretical side of activist media, and the remaining weeks will explore specific applications of new media in activist work and public scholarship.

### Unit II: Engaging in public scholarship

In this unit, which will comprise the final 6 weeks of the semester, students will choose a single event or movement to document or critique. This will be an ongoing or a recent event. The class will collaborate on building a web-based resource on the movement, using the media of the movement to document the movement. This website will consist of Twitter archives, podcasts, videos, photo essays, descriptive blog posts (historical or journalistic in style), editorial writings, and/or other media chosen by the class as appropriate for the movement. While not every student need produce material of every type, every student will engage multiple media in their work. Details will be decided by class consensus, under the guidance of the instructor.

For an example of the kind of project we might do, see Pete Rorabaugh's [Occupy Class](http://occupyclass.org) at Georgia State University.

## Assessment

The most important and interesting aspects of learning—especially at the graduate level—are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do, and *absolutely detrimental* to a class like this one.

That said, I am required to assign final grades for this course. My goal in grading is two-fold: to diminish their significance and the negative impact they can have on the learning environment, and to make sure that they do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

So grades will follow the following pattern: I expect no Ds and Fs, but those grades will be reserved for students who fail to internalize the "nuts and bolts" of the materials we engage. Cs will be given to students who sufficiently internalize that basic information, but no more. As and Bs are reserved for students who make new contributions to human knowledge, including the nuanced critique of existing knowledge or the connecting of previously discrete domains of knowledge in new and insightful ways.

In order to ensure that all serious students in the class attain a basic working knowledge of the course material, I will set the standard for a C. To obtain a C in the class, students must pass a series of weekly quizzes that cover the raw informational content of the week's readings. Passing a quiz means getting at least 9 out of 10 questions factually accurate. Passing the series of quizzes means passing *all but two quizzes* during the semester.

Each week, students will submit informational or conceptual questions two days in advance of class. All students will see all submitted questions, and will be able to prepare (individually or in collaboration) answers to these questions. I will select questions from this collection for each week's quiz. While you will know the questions in advance of the quiz, you will not be allowed notes during the quiz. This will ensure that the quiz is not a "trick," but instead a tool to ensure that during our class discussion everyone has the basic facts fresh in their mind, allowing us to go deeper with our critical discussion.

Generally there will be no makeups or reassessments; the two-quiz allowance should suffice for most cases. In exigent circumstances, other arrangements can be made at my discretion.

How exactly students may demonstrate the nuance, critique, and application required for an A or B will be negotiated among the class about half-way through the semester, as we decide the details of the final class project (Unit II).
