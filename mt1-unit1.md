# Unit I: Fundamentals and cognition

The primary goals for this unit are 1) for students to be able to gain and demonstrate *fast* fluency in the identification and production of fundamental elements of musical notation; and 2) for students to gain a preliminary understanding of the properties of human auditory cognition that underly basic musical structures.

## Materials ##

All required material for this unit will be posted here as we progress through the unit. Most materials will be drawn from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com), an online textbook I have been building over the past three years.

## Concepts and assessment

To pass the course, students must pass all of the following *fundamentals* assessments. These will be given as timed quizzes (60 seconds, unless noted otherwise below), either in class or online. Each concept can be assessed multiple times. Once passed, a student does not need to take a quiz on that concept again. Read all as "I can . . ."

- **meter** – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).  
- **time signatures** – write the appropriate time signature given a specified meter.  
- **rhythmic notation** – write the appropriate rhythmic notation (including beaming) for a passage of music, given a *protonotation* version of that passage.  
- **clefs** – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch ID** – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch writing** – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  
- **major scales** – write major scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **minor scales** – write minor scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **scale-degree ID** – identify the scale-degree (1–7) of pitches in specific keys.  
- **transposition** – transpose a melody from one key into another.  
- **interval ID** – identify the diatonic interval of a dyad.  
- **interval writing** – write a specified diatonic interval above or below a given pitch.  
- **triad ID** – identify root and quality of major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads.  
- **triad writing** – write major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads given root and quality.  
- **seventh ID** – identify root and quality of major, minor, dominant, fully diminished, and half-diminished seventh chords.  
- **seventh writing** – write major, minor, dominant, fully diminished, and half-diminished seventh chordss given root and quality.  
- **Roman numerals** – label a triad or seventh chord with the appropriate Roman numeral given a specified key.
