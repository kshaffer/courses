### Unit topics ###

The goal of this course (and the entire music theory and aural skills sequences) is musical fluency: that is, the successful depositing of musical information into readily-accessible long-term memory, and the successful cognitive assimilation of musical concepts and structures. 

This semester will introduce concepts of large-scale musical form, and the connections of formal structure to harmony, melody, and voice-leading. We will explore these concepts in the context of commercial pop/rock music and sonata-form movements of the classical era. The course will be divided into three units:

- Unit I: pop/rock music (form, harmony, voice-leading) – approx. weeks 1–6  
- Unit II: Classical themes (with chromaticism and modulation) – approx. weeks 7–10  
- Unit III: Sonata theory – approx. weeks 11–15  

More details are provided in the three unit guides.

### Assessment ###

Each student will receive a single letter grade for each unit, based on the number of musical concepts a student has mastered by the unit deadline. Those musical concepts are listed in each unit's guide (see above). Assessment details are provided in the unit guides.

A student's overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of all unit grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest unit grade—whichever is lower.

### Reassessment ###

In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts *within two weeks* of the unit deadline (the final unit of the semester will, for obvious reasons, have a shorter reassessment window). One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window.

The reassessment must be *completed* within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor *immediately* to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.
