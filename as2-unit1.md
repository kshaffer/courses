# Unit I: Diatonic melody and harmony #

Unit I will review and reinforce basic concepts of diatonic melody and harmony and standard rhythm, as well as skills in performing and recognizing musical structures by ear.

## Materials ##

In addition to exercises in the Berkowitz and/or Kazez texts, the following materials will be assigned or may supplement assigned materials in order to help you meet the goals outlined under *Concepts and assessment*, most of which can be found on Kris Shaffer's [Musicianship Resources](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship) website (which also contains helpful review materials). This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.

#### Fundamentals ####

- [Protonotation](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/protonotation.html).  
- [Meter and time signatures](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/meter.html).

- [Classical cadence types](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/cadenceTypes.html).  
- [Modulation](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/Modulation.html).  

#### Performance and listening ####

- [Realizing an unfigured bass line (video)](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/unfiguredBass.html) (these concepts overlap with analyzing harmonic progressions from a single bass line).  

#### Technology ####

- [Uploading and sharing a file via Google Drive](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/GDrive.html).

## Concepts and assessment ##

The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the [assessment guide]({{ root_url }}/as2-assess.html)) in Unit I are divided into three categories: *rhythm*, *melody*, and *harmony*. Those with deadlines in Unit I are listed below (though others will be addressed in class activities), followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as "I can . . ."

#### Rhythm ####

- perform straight, dotted, and syncopated rhythms in simple meter, with preparation (half-note beats) – 1x.  
- dictate/transcribe straight and dotted rhythms in simple meter, quickly and without an instrument (half-note beats) – 1x.  
- dictate/transcribe syncopated rhythms in simple meter, quickly and without an instrument (half-note beats) – 1x.  

#### Melodic pitch elements ####

- perform diatonic melodies with steps, small leaps, and arpeggiations of I and V<sup>7</sup>, with preparation – 1x.  
- dictate/transcribe diatonic melodies with steps, small leaps, and arpeggiations of I and V<sup>7</sup>, quickly and without an instrument – 1x.  

#### Harmonic pitch elements ####

- dictate/transcribe harmonic progressions containing 5/3 chords, 6/3 chords, and inversions of V<sup>7</sup>, quickly and without an instrument – 2x.  
- recognize common cadence types by ear, quickly and without an instrument – 1x.  

In-class or take-home/online assessment activities will be given for all of these concepts and skills, as well as some concepts and skills that have deadlines in future units. These assignments and quizzes will provide sufficient opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery by the unit deadline. Additional attempts then become the responsibility of the student to be submitted or performed during office hours.
