# {{ page.title }}

Music is an art. Music is a language. Music is therapy. Music is [a clinical tool](http://www.musictherapy.org). Music is a [weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations). Music is an area of humanistic inquiry. Music is math. Music is neuroscience. Music is communal. Music is deeply personal. Music is [bug spray](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/13/entertainment/ca-musichurts13). Music is religion. Music is [identity formation](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3505052W/Music_in_Everyday_Life). Music is culture. Music is psychology.

Music is nearly unparalleled in its ability to engage just about every facet of our lives. Perhaps only language has the same reach into our biology, psychology, individual identity, and social community. Music both frames, and is dependent on, our memory. Music both affects and flows from our emotions. Music both embodies and transcends cultural prejudice. And despite its heavily scientific base, even professional musicians treat it with an air of mystery.

Music cognition explores all of these things. In a sense, music cognition is the study of music. And that is why to be a "cognitive musicologist" is as vague as to be a "musician." Some cognitive musicologists study the scientific basis of music theory; some explore the anthropological side of music in community; others are psychologists, neurologists, or psycholinguists with an interest in music; still others are therapists, studying music for its clinical value and employing it in the treatment of Alzheimers, autism, amnesia, or stroke-enduced aphasia.

A course in music cognition could easily become a class in neurology, psychology, linguistics, computational analysis, medicine... This class will serve as an overview of concepts that are foundational to these areas, and an introduction to some of those more specific fields. Final projects will afford students opportunities to delve deeply into one of these areas in accordance with their interests and goals.

## Starting out

After examining the information on this page carefully, please go to the assignment guide and watch my introductory video for the course. Then make a 1-minute video of yourself in which you give your name as you'd like us to call you, and either what you find most interesting about this course or what you'd most like to learn in this course, and upload it to the course discussion forum. If you plan on using a Twitter account for this course (see below), sign up (if necessary), and then send a tweet to me with the course hashtag. Something like, "Hey, @krisshaffer, I'm getting set up for the summer #muscog course!" The course hashtag will help others in the course find you, and tagging me will let me know to follow you (so you can send me private messages) and add you to my list. I'll re-tweet your message to make sure others in the course see it (since new Twitter users don't always show up in hashtag search results for a while).

Once you've posted your video and connected with me on Twitter, watch your classmates' videos and try to find/follow them on Twitter by searching for "#muscog".

We will be using both public and private online fora for class discussions. Because things posted online disappear far more slowly than things that are spoken (if they ever disappear), and since typed text lacks the nuances of body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, it is even more important to take care in promoting an environment of openness and respect. Please review the "classroom behavior" section on my [course policies](policies.html) document, and commit to doing your part to foster an environment where intellectual challenges are welcome, but always put forward with the utmost respect.

## Prerequisite knowledge

Because music cognition is a heavily interdisciplinary field, I do not expect all students to come into the course at the same level of understanding of every topic we study. In fact, I expect that some of you will be more expert than me on some of the topics we cover. As many educators have said before me, "All of us are smarter than any of us," and we will seek to build on our complementary expertises, under my guidance as a music theoretical expert who has done both research and teaching in the cognitive science of music. That said, all students should be at least upper-division undergraduates majoring in one of the fields this course engages (psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, music, linguistics, medicine, clinical therapy, etc.). This will ensure that all students have built a strong foundation in a field that will serve as a point of reference from which to relate to the topics of this course, and a base of expertise from which they can speak in our group discussions. Permission of the instructor may also be granted to students not meeting these prerequisites but who are otherwise prepared to engage these materials and contribute to our discussions.

## Required course materials

- Bob Snyder, [*Music and Memory: An Introduction*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2782993W/Music_and_Memory).  
- David Huron, [*Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5851060W/Sweet_Anticipation).  
- [*Open Music Theory*](http://www.openmusictheory.com) (free web access).  
- A web-enabled device that is capable of reading online text, accessing the course website, recording video, and participating in group video chats.    
- A free Google account *using your CU Identikey* (see [OIT's Google Apps page](http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/messaging-collaboration/google-apps) for detailed information and support).  
- A free, public Twitter account (optional; pseudonyms allowed; please read [privacy policy](https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en) before deciding to sign up).

All other required class materials will be posted or linked to on the course site.

N.B.: Before purchasing the two textbooks, please consider the choice of print v. electronic carefully. Research suggests that paper copies help most people retain information better than electronic books. On the other hand, ebooks are searchable in ways that print books are not. And, of course, cost is a factor. Finally, some ebook publishers collect data from consumers' ereaders, while others (and paper, of course) do not.

## Coursework

Students will be provided with the following informational resources to engage during each unit:

*Readings* drawn from the required textbooks, and occasional supplemental resources such as scholarly articles from the field.

*Videos* created by me, which will offer audio/visual explanations of concepts in the reading, demonstrations of how those concepts are applied in specific situations, contradictory perspectives to those expressed in the readings, and alternative explanations.

*Core concept lists* will be provided for each unit, as well as a [master list for the course](cognitionOnline-concepts.html), which will form the basis for the conceptual videos and maps (and assessment requirements) listed below.

Assessed coursework will include the following:

*Conceptual videos.* For each core concept in a unit of study, create a video of *no more than 60 seconds* in which you explain the concept in your own words and present at least one example or application to elucidate that explanation. For example, in explaining the concept of *interference*, you can present a song in which the melody for each verse is almost, but not quite, identical, making it more difficult to memorize or perform upon first encounter. Videos that explain the concept accurately and coherently with a relevant example will receive full assessment credit. Videos submitted by the deadline but not up to standard will be allowed a single reassesment opportunity within 48 hours of feedback being posted. For each concept, the student who produces the video that is deemed the most clear and engaging will be given the opportunity to share it with the class and the public on the course Vimeo channel. Throughout the course, and especially at the end of our core concept study, this channel will provide a high-quality set of concise explanations for student review and public consumption.

*Online discussion.* We will have a private discussion forum for registered students, a public discussion forum (Twitter, using the hashtag #muscog), and twice-weekly video-chat office hours. These are the primary places for you to ask questions of clarification, to compare notes with each other as you work on assignments, and for me to ask provocative questions about the readings, videos, and potential points of application. You are expected to engage in at least one of these fora during each unit of study, but are encouraged to take advantage of all of them when possible.

*Conceptual mapping.* You will create a visual diagram that maps out our core concepts and their relationships. These diagrams should include each of the core concepts for each unit, with lines drawn between concepts that are related, and a written or verbal explanation of each relationship (between one sentence and one paragraph per relationship). You will build one master concept map over the entirety of the course, but will submit drafts at the end of each week of the course, including all concepts covered up to that date. Conceptual maps can be drawn on paper with pencil (and submitted as a photo, high enough resolution to be legible), an electronic diagram (using Adobe Illustrator, Prezi, etc.), or a physical diagram created on a wall/floor etc. (submitted as a photo or video and accompanied by a written or audio/video explanation of the connections).

*Final project.* If you wish to obtain an A in the class, you will construct a final project that applies course concepts in a domain not discussed in class, or critiques some presentation of material in class. You and I will negotiate the details of these projects one-on-one, with the goals of 1) finding a project in line with your interests, 2) adding to public human knowledge/understanding, and 3) moving beyond the memorization, understanding, and synthesis of course concepts into the realm of application and critique. Shortly after midterm, you will have an opportunity to propose project ideas, and our negotiations will be completed before the final 1/4 of the term, with a clear contract of expectations laid out. You may only pursue the A-level final project once you have completed the assessment requirements for a B (see below).

## Assessment

The most important and interesting aspects of learning are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.

My goal in grading is three-fold: to diminish their significance and the negative impact they can have on the learning environment, to direct your studies clearly (but flexibly), and to make sure that they do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

I expect no Ds and Fs, but those grades will be reserved for students who fail to internalize the "nuts and bolts" of cognitive musicology. Cs will be given to students who sufficiently internalize most of those basic concepts, but no more. As and Bs are reserved for students who master those concepts and demonstrate an ability to synthesize and apply them in complex, even novel, ways.

Specifically, students who successfully meet the following standards will receive the corresponding grades:

- F: Failure to meet the minimum requirements for a D (below).  
- D: Successfully complete at least 50% of the concept video assessments and participate in an online discussion forum for at least 50% of the units of study.  
- C: Successfully complete at least 75% of the concept video assessments and participate in an online discussion forum for at least 75% of the units of study.  
- B: Successfully complete 100% of the concept video assessments, participate in an online discussion forum for at least 90% of the units of study, and create a "concept map" for the course.  
- A: Successfully complete all B-level requirements and perform a final synthesis/application project, the details of which will be negotiated with the instructor between midterm and 3/4 of the way through the course.

N.B.: Since there are three fora for online discussion, significant participation in any one of them during a unit of study will suffice for the participation requirement.


## Reaching the instructor

The best ways to reach me during the course are email and Twitter. Please allow up to 24 hours for a response, though during summer courses, I tend to respond much more quickly than that. Messages sent on Saturday or Sunday will likely not receive a reply until Monday.


## Technical support

Students can obtain technical support for the technologies used in class by consulting Lynda.com (accessible via [MyCUInfo](https://fedauth.colorado.edu/idp/Authn/UserPassword)), the [CU OIT student help desk](http://www.colorado.edu/oit/support-training/it-service-center), and/or the instructor.
