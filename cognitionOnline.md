# {{ page.title }}

Music is an art. Music is a language. Music is therapy. Music is [a clinical tool](http://www.musictherapy.org). Music is a [weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations). Music is an area of humanistic inquiry. Music is math. Music is neuroscience. Music is communal. Music is deeply personal. Music is [bug spray](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/13/entertainment/ca-musichurts13). Music is religion. Music is [identity formation](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3505052W/Music_in_Everyday_Life). Music is culture. Music is psychology.

Music is nearly unparalleled in its ability to engage just about every facet of our lives. Perhaps only language has the same reach into our biology, psychology, individual identity, and social community. Music both frames, and is dependent on, our memory. Music both affects and flows from our emotions. Music both embodies and transcends cultural prejudice. And despite its heavily scientific base, even professional musicians treat it with an air of mystery.

Music cognition explores all of these things. In a sense, music cognition is the study of music. And that is why to be a "cognitive musicologist" is as vague as to be a "musician." Some cognitive musicologists study the scientific basis of music theory; some explore the anthropological side of music in community; others are psychologists, neurologists, or psycholinguists with an interest in music; still others are therapists, studying music for its clinical value and employing it in the treatment of Alzheimers, autism, amnesia, or stroke-enduced aphasia.

A course in music cognition could easily become a class in neurology, psychology, linguistics, computational analysis, medicine... This class will serve as an overview of concepts that are foundational to these areas, and an introduction to some of those more specific fields. Final projects will afford students opportunities to delve deeply into one of these areas in accordance with their interests and goals.

### Coursework

Students will be provided with the following informational resources to engage during each unit:

*Readings* drawn from the required textbooks, and occasional supplemental resources such as scholarly articles from the field.

*Videos* created by me, which will offer audio/visual explanations of concepts in the reading, demonstrations of how those concepts are applied in specific situations, contradictory perspectives to those expressed in the readings, and alternative explanations.

*Core concept lists* will be provided for each unit, as well as a [master list for the course](cognitionOnline-concepts.html), which will form the basis for the conceptual videos and maps (and assessment requirements) listed below.

Assessed coursework will include the following:

*Conceptual videos.* In each unit, several core concepts will be identified. Each student will create a video of *no more than 60 seconds* in which they explain the concept in their own words and present at least one example or application to elucidate their explanation. For example, in explaining the concept of *interference*, a student can present a song in which the melody for each verse is almost, but not quite, identical, making it more difficult to memorize or perform upon first encounter. Videos that explain the concept accurately and coherently with a relevant example will receive full assessment credit. Videos submitted by the deadline but not up to standard will be allowed a single reassesment opportunity within 48 hours of feedback being posted. For each concept, the student who produces the video that is deemed the most clear and engaging will be given the opportunity to share it with the class and the public on the course Vimeo channel. This channel will provide a high-quality set of concise explanations of concepts for student review and public consumption.

*Online discussion.* We will have a private discussion forum for registered students, a public discussion option (Twitter, using the hashtag #muscog), and twice-weekly video-chat office hours. These are the primary places for students to ask questions of clarification, to compare notes as they work on assignments, and for me to ask provocative questions about the readings, videos, and potential points of application. Students are expected to engage in at least one of these fora during each unit of study, but are encouraged to take advantage of all of them when possible.

*Conceptual mapping.* Students will be asked not only to explain concepts in video form, but to create a visual diagram that maps out these concepts and their relationships. These diagrams should include each of the core concepts identified for each unit, with lines drawn between concepts that are related, and a written or verbal explanation of each relationship (between one sentence and one paragraph per relationship). Students will build one master concept map over the entirety of the course, but will submit drafts at the end of each week of the course, including all concepts covered to date. Conceptual maps can be drawn on paper with pencil (and submitted as a photo, high enough resolution to be legible), an electronic diagram (using Adobe Illustrator, Prezi, or the like), or a physical diagram created on a wall/floor etc. (submitted as a photo or video and accompanied by a written or audio/video explanation of the connections).

*Final project.* Students wishing to obtain an A in the class will construct a final project that applies course concepts in a domain not discussed in class, or critiques some presentation of material in class. These projects will be negotiated one-on-one with the instructor, with the goals of 1) finding a project in line with the individual student's interests, 2) adding to public human knowledge/understanding, and 3) moving beyond the memorization, understanding, and synthesis of course concepts into the realm of application and critique. Projects will be proposed by students shortly after midterm, and negotiations completed before the final 1/4 of the term, with a clear contract of expectations laid out. Students may only pursue the A-level final project once they have completed the assessment requirements for a B (see below).

### Assessment

The most important and interesting aspects of learning are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.

That said, I am required to assign final grades for this course. My goal in grading is three-fold: to diminish their significance and the negative impact they can have on the learning environment, to direct your studies clearly (but flexibly), and to make sure that they do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

So grades will follow the following pattern: I expect no Ds and Fs, but those grades will be reserved for students who fail to internalize the "nuts and bolts" of cognitive musicology. Cs will be given to students who sufficiently internalize most of those basic concepts, but no more. As and Bs are reserved for students who master those concepts and demonstrate an ability to synthesize and apply them in complex, even novel, ways.

Specifically, students who successfully meet the following standards will receive the corresponding grades:

- F: failure to meet the minimum requirements for a D (below).  
- D: successfully complete at least 50% of the concept video assessments and participate in online discussion fora for at least 50% of the units of study.  
- C: successfully complete at least 75% of the concept video assessments and participate in online discussion fora for at least 75% of the units of study.  
- B: successfully complete 100% of the concept video assessments, participate in online discussion fora for at least 90% of the units of study, and create a "concept map" for the course.  
- A: successfully complete all B-level requirements and perform a final synthesis/application project, the details of which will be negotiated with the instructor between 50% and 75% of the way through the course.

N.B.: Since there are three fora for online discussion, significant participation in any one of them during a unit of study will suffice for the participation assessment.
