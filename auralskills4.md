## Musical concepts and fluency

The goal of this course is musical fluency: that is, the successful depositing of musical information into readily-accessible long-term memory, and the successful cognitive assimilation of musical concepts and structures.

We will seek an advanced level of fluency in tonal music (with chromaticism and modulation) - Unit I (roughly weeks 1–7), and an introductory level of fluency with basic elements of post-tonal music – Unit II (roughly weeks 8–15).

## Assessment

Assessment will be performed in reference to four categories of musical skills and concepts: 

- *modulation* (Unit I)  
- *post-tonal pitch materials* (Unit II)  
- *advanced rhythm and meter* (Unit II) 

Each category contains between three and five specific concepts or skills (see unit guides). At any point in the semester, for each category/skill, students will have a current mark of **N – not attempted**, **A – attempted**, or **P – passed**.

A student’s letter grade for a given category is determined by the number of those specific concepts or skills for which the student demonstrates mastery (mark of P – passed) by the end of the appropriate unit of study, according to the following scale:

- A: mastery of all concepts/skills in the category  
- B: mastery of all but one  
- C: mastery of all but two  
- D: mastery of all but three  
- F: anything less than D

Generally, students will be given multiple opportunities during each unit to demonstrate mastery of each concept, and only their performance on the *most recent* assessment attempt(s) will count towards the unit grade. More details are provided in the unit guides.

**A student's overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of all unit grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest unit grade — whichever is lower.**

Examples:

To receive a final grade of A, a student needs a median grade of A for the three unit grades, and nothing lower than a B. So A A A, or A A B for the three unit grades would resuli in a final grade of A.

To receive a final grade of B, a student needs a median unit grade of B, and nothing lower than a C. So unit grades of A B B, A B C, B B B, or B B C would result in a final grade of B.

## Reassessment

In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts *within two weeks* of the unit deadline. One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window.

The reassessment must be *completed* within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor *immediately* to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.
