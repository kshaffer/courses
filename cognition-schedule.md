- Bob Snyder, *Music and Memory*, [Chapter 2, "Echoic Memory"](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/file/d/0B9o4hmKNoi6cZ2xaYXB2ZFBMOUk/edit?usp=sharing)  
- Bob Snyder, *Music and Memory*, [Chapter 3, "Grouping"](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/file/d/0B9o4hmKNoi6celgzaUJjSWtNS28/edit?usp=sharing)

***By Wednesday, 10am***, submit four factual questions about the readings (one question per chapter) to the [quiz preparation Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/140ud08vy-oY9IyoB5rdP1UincPH6D0ji-mR_JMyGV_U/edit?usp=sharing) for the week. Your quiz cannot count as passing if you do not submit these questions on time. 

Then find and memorize answers to all of the questions in the document and be prepared to answer them on a quiz at the beginning of Friday's class. (I will choose 10â€“12 of your 32 questions.)

If you have questions about these readings in advance of class, you can discuss them with each other in person, stop by my office, use the comments feature of Google Drive, or tweet questions with the course hashtag (#muscog).
