## October 17 prep

Please read [Chromatically altered subdominant chords](http://openmusictheory.com/alteredSubdominants.html) on Open Music Theory. Review the [worksheet](materials/alteredSChords-WS.pdf) and [model solutions](materials/alteredSChords-key.pdf) from Monday's class alongside the reading. Then fill out the following form.

## October 15 prep

First, read the [Unit II Guide](mt3-unit2.html). Then read two resources on Open Music Theory: [Composing in basso-continuo style](http://openmusictheory.com/bassoContinuo.html) (think "keyboard-style four-part writing") and [Tendency tones and functional harmonic dissonances](http://openmusictheory.com/tendencyTonesFunctionalDissonances.html). Though some of the terms may be different, these should generally be a review of some of your studies from last semester.

After reading these materials, please fill out the following form **before 7:30am on Wednesday** (so I can look them over before class).

## October 13 prep

None.

## October 6 prep

**If you have passed all four pop/rock form concepts on one of the three assessments,** please do the following:

- Choose a partner with whom you will work well (and with whose schedule you will be able to coordinate).  
- Choose a song that has interesting formal, harmonic, and/or voice-leading features. (You may run an idea by me in advance, but I will leave you all to pick your own songs.)  
- [Sign up for a 20-minute time slot](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY) for an oral exam with me on either **Monday, Oct. 6, or Wednesday, Oct. 8, between 9am and noon.** (Please be sure when you sign up for a time that your Google Calendar is showing Mountain Time. If you have issues signing up, please email me or stop by my office.)  
- Prepare a 5–10 minute presentation, video, slideshow, etc. according to the guidelines on the [Unit I Guide](mt3-unit1.html).  
- Come to your oral exam ready to explain to me, with nuance, the musical structure of your song, and be prepared to field questions from me about the song's form, harmony, and/or voice-leading.

**If you have not passed all four pop/rock form concepts on one of the three assessments,** please do the following:

- For each of the four concepts that you did not pass *on the last assessment you attempted*, write a single paragraph (in a Google Doc, please—not a Word doc uploaded to Google Drive) or make a video of less than 3 minutes. In each paragraph or video, explain your understanding of the concept and how it plays out in pop/rock music. Reference pieces covered in class or on assignments. Be sure to demonstrate that you have come to a solid understanding of the concept since that last assessment, or that you understand it solidly in spite of that last assessment.  
- Submit your writing or video via Google Drive, per the usual instructions, by **Wednesday, October 8, 9am at the latest.**

## *September 30* prep

Review the [class notes from Sept. 29](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1INlUI_em3mfsqS7rC6rrUZq9WZxLdG4qE5PHaITfRt8/edit?usp=sharing) in Google Drive.

**Before 9am on Tuesday, Sept. 30,** add one insight to the document. This can either be a new passage that "breaks the rules" in terms of classical voice-leading practices, or a factor that makes one of the listed examples of "rule-breaking" okay in this context. We will discuss your insights in class on Wednesday.

## September 29 assessment

Please see details for [Pop/Rock Assessment 3](materials/mt3-PopRockAnalysis3.html). Be sure to make use of the [Pop/rock form resource](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html) and the model analyses from Assessments  1 & 2 (in the [class shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cT29FblliMTk0NUE&authuser=1)).

Note that this is the *last* timeline assessment opportunity of the unit.

## *September 23* prep

I am giving you all a choice of topic for Wednesday's class. However, in order to prepare, I need to know your preference in advance. So please fill out the following form ***by 9am, Tuesday, Sep. 23*** so I can use the results to plan class for Wednesday. 

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rBzEpJsbrL3u7Mk1GMi5Q5WOG4RTvtX9No5fxiNoglw/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>

Also, please compare your Assessment 2 submission with the model analyses that I posted in the [class shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cT29FblliMTk0NUE&authuser=1). Note any questions you have, and bring them to class on Wednesday.

## September 22 assessment

Please see details for [Pop/Rock Assessment 2](materials/mt3-PopRockAnalysis2.html). Be sure to make use of the [Pop/rock form resource](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html) and the model analyses from Assessment 1 (in the [class shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cT29FblliMTk0NUE&authuser=1)).

## September 17 prep

Review the [Form in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html) resource as necessary, and come to class with a *written* answer to the following question:

> What is the difference between strophic form and AABA form?

Also, review the model analyses for Assessment 1 (in the class shared folder on Google Drive), compare them with your own, and come to class with questions about any differences between them that you cannot explain or figure out for yourself. Getting these questions answered will help you on Assessment 2, which will be due on September 22.

## September 15 assessment

Please see details for Pop/Rock Assessment 1 [here](materials/mt3-PopRockAnalysis1.html).

## September 10 prep

Examine your colleagues' timelines for "The Moment I Said It" (in the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6ca1lYNUtpWTd6V1E&usp=sharing)) from the Sept. 8 class activity. Where others' timelines differ from yours, evaluate the differences critically and decide if their's is an improvement on yours. If so, come to your group on Wednesday with specific suggestions on how to improve your timeline, with explanations of *why* those specific changes are improvements.

Additionally, for any unfinished aspects of your timeline (the final timeline should have all phrases, modules, cycles, and the overall song form denoted and labeled), come with ideas for your group to decide on as you finish. Listen to the piece again (audio is in the shared GDrive folder) and consult the [Form in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html) resource as appropriate.

There will be a major individual assessment due Monday, September 15, that will consist of making formal timelines on your own, so invest in doing this group analysis well. Take this opportunity to clear up questions about the concepts, as well as the technology, before the individual assessment.

## September 8 prep

Read the entire glossary of terms for [Form in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html). Familiarize yourself generally with the glossary, but focus in detail on things related to *phrases* and *cycles*.

In light of that reading and the timeline of "Pleasant Valley Sunday" that I placed in the Google Drive folder along with the audio from last week, come to class with *written* answers to the following questions. (Feel free to work with others to figure out answers to these questions, but make sure that you write the answers in your own words and that you understand what you are writing.)

- In the timeline of "Pleasant Valley Sunday," some phrases are labeled with *s*, *r*, *d*, and *c*. What do those mean? Why were those labels used for those phrases?  
- In the bridge, phrases were labeled *a* and *a'*. Why not *a* and *a*? Why not *a* and *b*?  
- What does the **J** in this timeline mean? Why are those two passages labeled **J**?


## September 3 prep

Review [the notes from class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bzqo3JGihPOrlvmtDI5pAZeyg4wDJT77MFfJ1L35-Vg/edit?usp=sharing). Then read Section III (Formal functions) in [Form in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html) and use the definitions provided there to mediate the competing claims in the class notes and make a definitive decision as to the form of the piece.

Download and install [Variations Audio Timeliner](http://variations.sourceforge.net/vat/) on your computer, or use the CAML labs—N1B46 & N1B49.

Watch [my demo video](http://vimeo.com/42041355) on how to use Variations.

Make a timeline (individually or with one other person) of "Pleasant Valley Sunday" in light of your new analysis (audio is in the class shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cT29FblliMTk0NUE&usp=sharing); Log in as if your email address is YourIdentiKey@colorado.edu, and use your IdentiKey password.). Make a single layer of formal divisions, and use only the following terms: intro, outro, strophe, bridge, verse, prechorus, chorus. (Essentially, choose one of the two analyses presented in class and make it into a timeline.)

Name the file "LASTNAME Pleasant Valley Sunday Timeline.v2t" (be sure to include both last names if working in pairs). Upload the timeline file (not the audio) to Google Drive and share it with me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu) before the beginning of class. See [this short video](https://vimeo.com/73001492) for uploading/sharing instructions of you are new to Google Drive. Make sure you share it from your CU Google Apps account.

Finally, be sure to bring a web-enabled device to class.
