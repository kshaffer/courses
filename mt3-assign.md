Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## September 10 prep

Examine your colleagues' timelines for "The Moment I Said It" (in the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6ca1lYNUtpWTd6V1E&usp=sharing)) from the Sept. 8 class activity. Where others' timelines differ from yours, evaluate the differences critically and decide if their's is an improvement on yours. If so, come to your group on Wednesday with specific suggestions on how to improve your timeline, with explanations of *why* those specific changes are improvements.

Additionally, for any unfinished aspects of your timeline (the final timeline should have all phrases, modules, cycles, and the overall song form denoted and labeled), come with ideas for your group to decide on as you finish. Listen to the piece again (audio is in the shared GDrive folder) and consult the [Form in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html) resource as appropriate.

There will be a major individual assessment due Monday, September 15, that will consist of making formal timelines on your own, so invest in doing this group analysis well. Take this opportunity to clear up questions about the concepts, as well as the technology, before the individual assessment.

## September 8 prep

Read the entire glossary of terms for [Form in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html). Familiarize yourself generally with the glossary, but focus in detail on things related to *phrases* and *cycles*.

In light of that reading and the timeline of "Pleasant Valley Sunday" that I placed in the Google Drive folder along with the audio from last week, come to class with *written* answers to the following questions. (Feel free to work with others to figure out answers to these questions, but make sure that you write the answers in your own words and that you understand what you are writing.)

- In the timeline of "Pleasant Valley Sunday," some phrases are labeled with *s*, *r*, *d*, and *c*. What do those mean? Why were those labels used for those phrases?  
- In the bridge, phrases were labeled *a* and *a'*. Why not *a* and *a*? Why not *a* and *b*?  
- What does the **J** in this timeline mean? Why are those two passages labeled **J**?


## September 3 prep

Review [the notes from class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bzqo3JGihPOrlvmtDI5pAZeyg4wDJT77MFfJ1L35-Vg/edit?usp=sharing). Then read Section III (Formal functions) in [Form in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html) and use the definitions provided there to mediate the competing claims in the class notes and make a definitive decision as to the form of the piece.

Download and install [Variations Audio Timeliner](http://variations.sourceforge.net/vat/) on your computer, or use the CAML labsâ€”N1B46 & N1B49.

Watch [my demo video](http://vimeo.com/42041355) on how to use Variations.

Make a timeline (individually or with one other person) of "Pleasant Valley Sunday" in light of your new analysis (audio is in the class shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cT29FblliMTk0NUE&usp=sharing); Log in as if your email address is YourIdentiKey@colorado.edu, and use your IdentiKey password.). Make a single layer of formal divisions, and use only the following terms: intro, outro, strophe, bridge, verse, prechorus, chorus. (Essentially, choose one of the two analyses presented in class and make it into a timeline.)

Name the file "LASTNAME Pleasant Valley Sunday Timeline.v2t" (be sure to include both last names if working in pairs). Upload the timeline file (not the audio) to Google Drive and share it with me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu) before the beginning of class. See [this short video](https://vimeo.com/73001492) for uploading/sharing instructions of you are new to Google Drive. Make sure you share it from your CU Google Apps account.

Finally, be sure to bring a web-enabled device to class.
