## September 3 prep

Review [the notes from class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bzqo3JGihPOrlvmtDI5pAZeyg4wDJT77MFfJ1L35-Vg/edit?usp=sharing). Then read Section III (Formal functions) in [Form in pop/rock music](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html) and use the definitions provided there to mediate the competing claims in the class notes and make a definitive decision as to the form of the piece.

Download and install [Variations Audio Timeliner](http://variations.sourceforge.net/vat/) on your computer, or use the CAML labsâ€”N1B46 & N1B49.

Watch [my demo video](http://vimeo.com/42041355) on how to use Variations.

Make a timeline (individually or with one other person) of "Pleasant Valley Sunday" in light of your new analysis (audio is in the class shared Google Drive folder). Make a single layer of formal divisions, and use only the following terms: intro, outro, strophe, bridge, verse, prechorus, chorus. (Essentially, choose one of the two analyses presented in class and make it into a timeline.)

Name the file "LASTNAME Pleasant Valley Sunday Timeline.v2t" (be sure to include both last names if working in pairs). Upload the timeline file (not the audio) to Google Drive and share it with me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu) before the beginning of class. See [this short video](https://vimeo.com/73001492) for uploading/sharing instructions of you are new to Google Drive. Make sure you share it from your CU Google Apps account. (Log in as if your email address is YourIdentiKey@colorado.edu, and use your IdentiKey password.)

Finally, be sure to bring a web-enabled device to class.
