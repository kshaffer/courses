## Overview

Each student will write one standard academic paper. Students can choose a midterm paper on a German Lied or a final paper on a post-tonal work.

These papers should be 1000–1500 words (4–6 pages, double-spaced), should have a single analytical thesis, should argue that thesis with supporting evidence and no extraneous details, and should conform to the *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th. ed. (This is *not* a genre in which we will be pushing stylistic boundaries, but instead working on excelling at artful conformity: meeting set expectations while also standing out via a strong argument and/or well crafted prose.)

Examples of model essays from past student work (anonymous) will be provided in advance of the due dates (see below).

Students will also have the opportunity to sign up for a 20-minute consultation on a draft of their paper with me in the week before papers are due.

Papers will be due on the first day of post-tonal studies (Lied papers) or the first day of finals week (post-tonal papers).

Papers should be written as Google Documents (not Word Documents uploaded to Google Drive), shared with kris.shaffer@colorado.edu with editing privileges, and the sharing link [pasted into this form](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/forms/d/1WUImrrWmJrNyZod_Qux-Kw1dxPdWetAOjW1L2KIjj_Y/viewform?usp=send_form).

## German Lied paper

**Due date: Monday, March 9 (M/W section) or Tuesday, March 10 (T/R section), 10am**  

**Topic option one: An analysis of a 19th-century, German, Romantic Lied of your choice** 

**Topic option two: A comparison of two 19th-century, German, Romantic settings of the same poem**  

**Suggested Lieder: anything by Schubert, Brahms, or Schumann that you can stand listening to repeatedly should work well! Schubert's *Winterreise* and Schumann's *Dichterliebe* provide many excellent choices.**

This paper, as stated above, in an exercise in "artful conformity" to a standard form of discourse that is important to master for life in the academy. Knowing how to write cogently about musical structure in general, and for academic audiences specifically, is an essential skill for every learned musician. This project will help you grow in that skill. (Coincidentally, an analytical essay on a German Lied is a common graduate entrance exam at CU.)

This paper, whether an analysis of one song or a comparison of two settings, should engage the composer's (or composers') interpretations of the poem and the specific musical details that lead you to your interpretation of their interpretations. 

Be sure that your paper makes an argument. You should have a clearly identifiable thesis (the Twitter essay version of the paper), and all analytical details included in the paper should support that thesis and participate in a coherent, logical, linear flow. Not every detail of your musical and poetic analyses should appear in the paper, only those critical to your argument. 

As this will be the last assessment opportunity for Unit I, make sure that your argument (and your choice of song) can sustain a discussion of those elements you still need to pass. For example, if you have passed pitch structures and rhythmic structures already, choose a piece and construct an argument that allows you to present a meaty analysis of form, secondary parameters, and the relationship of those details to the meaning of the text. If you need help choosing a piece in light of these things, please consult with me early.

The paper should be constructed in a Google document (see above), but should be laid out like a standard print paper: single-sided and double-spaced, using an 11- or 12-point serif font, with 1-inch margins on each side. The paper should conform to *The Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th ed., and/or Turabian’s *A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations*, 7th ed. (They present the same style guidelines, though CMoS provides more detail on musical terminology and nomenclature.) If quoting authors, use CMoS’s author-date style of citation, rather than footnotes or endnotes.
Be sure that in addition to following the general guidelines of CMoS, you pay attention to include a proper title page, a header on all pages except the title page that includes your last name and page number, and a references page at the end for any source you site or which you make substantial use of in your preparation (including course textbooks, and any scores or recordings you consult in your studies). No academic paper is complete without those elements.

N.B.: The choice of Chicago Style is significant. It is not simply my requiring you to fit my preferences, possibly in contrast to other professors' expectations in other classes. Chicago Style is *the* standard for academic writing on music, and it provides a greater level of detailed recommendations for musical writing.

A model paper (a comparison of Brahms's and Schumann's settings of "Mondnacht") can be [viewed here](materials/MondnachtComparison.pdf).

Students may sign up for a 20-minute consultation with me to go over a draft of their paper. These will take place on Tuesday–Thursday, March 3–5, in lieu of class meetings on March 4 & 5. You can [sign up here](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY). Before your consultation, share your Google Doc with me, so I can review it as we meet and discuss.

Be sure to follow the submission guidelines provided above, and contact me with questions well in advance.

Viel Glück!
