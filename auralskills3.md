### Musical concepts and fluency ###

The goal of this course is musical fluency: that is, the successful depositing of musical information into readily-accessible long-term memory, and the successful cognitive assimilation of musical concepts and structures. We will aim for fluency specifically in the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic structures of pop/rock music and the melodic, harmonic, schematic, and formal structures of classical-era instrumental music.

This pursuit of fluency also involves the development of corresponding musical skills, namely transcription (both slow with the aid of instruments or technology and quickly without isntrumental assistance) and performance (prepared, at sight, and improvised).

### Assessment ###

Assessment will be performed in reference to three categories of musical skills and concepts: 

- *pop/rock* (Unit I)  
- *classical transcription* (Unit II)  
- *classical improvisation* (Unit II) 

Each category contains four specific concepts or skills (see unit guides). At any point in the semester, for each category/skill, students will have a current mark of **N – not attempted**, **A – attempted**, or **P – passed**.

A student’s letter grade for a given category is determined by the number of those specific concepts or skills for which the student demonstrates mastery (mark of P – passed) by the end of the appropriate unit of study, according to the following scale:

- A: mastery of all concepts/skills in the category  
- B: mastery of three  
- C: mastery of two  
- D: mastery of one  
- F: mastery of zero

Generally, students will be given multiple opportunities during each unit to demonstrate mastery of each concept, or a significant amount of time in which to work on (and seek feedback on) a major project. More details are provided in the unit guides.

A student's overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of all unit grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest unit grade—whichever is lower.

### Reassessment ###

In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts *within two weeks* of the unit deadline. One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window. *Re*assessments are only permitted for concepts/skills that were assessed during the unit. (In other words, only concepts/skills with a mark of A can be reassessed, not those with a mark of N.)

The reassessment must be *completed* within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor *immediately* to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.
