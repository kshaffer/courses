# Unit I: Pop/rock transcription and performance #

Unit I will comprise an in-depth study of the transcription and performance of commercial pop/rock music. There will be a particular emphasis on the unique rhythmic and harmonic elements of this style. The goal is both to build fluent knowledge of the structural elements of this style and to build facility with the tasks of transcription and performanceâ€”both prepared and at sight.

This unit will be centered around the creation of a set of transcriptions of pop/rock songs. Students will create these transcriptions in fulfillment of the first unit objective, and will use the scores from these transcriptions for the completion of the prepared performance objectives. These transcriptions may also be valuable for studies in Unit I of Music Theory 3.

## Materials ##

This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.



## Concepts and assessment ##

The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the [syllabus]({{ root_url }}/auralskills3.html)) comprise a single category: *pop/rock*. They are listed below. These objectives must be completed *in order*. 

Read all concept/skill objectives as "I can . . ."

- Transcribe all pitched elements of a pop/rock song of moderate complexity.  
- Perform a complete pop/rock song of moderate complexity in a group, with preparation. (This objective may be skipped if the following objective is successfully completed.)  
- Perform the melody of a pop/rock song of moderate complexity, with preparation.  
- Perform the melody of a pop/rock song of moderate complexity, at sight.

All performance objectives may be completed on the instrument or voice of the student's choosing.

To obtain a P, the objective must be completed perfectly or nearly so. The end-of-unit grade for this category will be determined by the number of objectives successfully met (in order):

- A: all four objectives met  
- B: 3 objectives met  
- C: 2 objectives met  
- D: 1 objective met  
- F: 0 objectives met
