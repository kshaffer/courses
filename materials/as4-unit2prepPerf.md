## Unit II prepared performance portfolio instructions ##

This assignment is designed to help you build connections between your primary instrument/voice experience and the post-tonal pitch and rhythm elements of this unit, as well as to prepare you for sight-reading these post-tonal pitch and rhythm structures on your primary instrument.

There are two short excerpts, one from Leonard Bernstein's "Jeremiah" Symphony and one from Béla Bartók's Concerto for Orchestra. (Your Bernstein performance will count towards the advanced meter assessment objective, Bartók towards the post-tonal pitch assessment objective.)

Go to the [folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cSmwtZlV2TW5wQTQ&usp=sharing), and download the scores of these two excerpts for your clef.

Then practice performing them on your primary instrument/voice (or a secondary instrument, if you prefer) until you can perform them *accurately* and *at the tempo indicated*, while observing all expressive markings. Vocalists do not need to use solfège, unless they feel that would help them. Once you are performing the excerpt consistently well, record it and submit it (instructions below).

Note that while one excerpt counts towards a pitch objective and one towards a rhythm objective, *all aspects of the music must be performed accurately to pass*. (In other words, the excerpts have been chosen because they will push you on either rhythm or pitch, but since no musical performance is up to standard if one of those is lacking, only performances that are satisfactory in pitch, rhythm, articulation, dynamics, and tempo will pass.)

To record and submit these videos, do the following:

- Video yourself performing each passage, according to the instructions above  
- Name those videos "YOURLASTNAME - name of composer". (You can also perform them in a single video.)  
- Upload each video to Google Drive and share them with your instructor

All videos most be submitted and must be performed *perfectly or nearly so* by the beginning of class on Monday/Tuesday, April 13/14. *Only videos submitted on time will be allowed a (single) reassessment opportunity.*
