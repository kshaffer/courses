## Unit II scale/collection performance portfolio instructions ##

To help you familizarize yourselves with standard scales and collections in post-tonal music, as well as to connect the sound of those collections with notation and the feel of them in your hands, you will practice and record yourself singing the following scales/modes/collections ascending and descending:

- octatonic (no solfège — sing the form that begins half-step – whole-step)  
- whole-tone (no solfège)  
- acoustic (do re mi fi sol la te do)  
- "major" pentatonic (do re mi sol la do)  
- "minor" pentatonic (do me fa sol te do)  
- dorian (do re me fa sol la te do)  
- phrygian (do ra me fa sol le te do)  
- lydian (do re mi fi sol la ti do)  
- mixolydian (do re mi fa sol la te do)  

Please practice with an instrument, but record yourself singing these one octave, ascending and descending, without the aid of an instrument. You can perform in any key that is comfortable for your range. All non-diatonic collections can be found on the [Analyzying atonal music resource](http://openmusictheory.com/atonal.html).

To record and submit these videos, do the following:

- Practice the scales/collections above  
- Video yourself performing the passages, according to the instructions above  
- Name those videos "YOURLASTNAME - name of collection". (You can also perform them in a single video.)  
- Upload video(s) to Google Drive and put them in a single folder named "YOURLASTNAME – modes and cells"  
- Share that folder with your instructor

Submit at least five of these (your choice) by the beginning of class on Wednesday/Thursday, March 18/19. Then submit the rest (along with any redos necessary) by Monday/Tuesday, April 6/7.

All videos most be submitted and must be performed *perfectly or nearly so* by the beginning of class on Monday/Tuesday, April 6/7. *Only videos submitted on time will be allowed a (single) reassessment opportunity.*
