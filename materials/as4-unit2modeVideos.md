## Unit II scale/collection performance portfolio instructions ##

To help you familizarize yourselves with standard scales and collections in post-tonal music, as well as to connect the sound of those collections with notation and the feel of them in your hands, you will practice and record yourself singing the following scales/modes/collections ascending and descending:

- octatonic (no solfège)  
- whole-tone (no solfège)  
- acoustic (do re mi fi sol la te do)  
- "major" pentatonic (do re mi sol la do)  
- "minor" pentatonic (do me fa sol te do)  
- dorian (do re me fa sol la te do)  
- phrygian (do ra me fa sol le te do)  
- lydian (do re mi fi sol la ti do)  
- mixolydian (do re mi fa sol la te do)  

Please practice with an instrument, but record yourself singing without the aid of an instrument. You can perform in any key that is comfortable for your range. All non-diatonic collections can be found on the [Analyzying atonal music resource](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/atonal.html).

To record and submit these videos, do the following:

- Practice the scales/collections above (only the measure numbers listed)
- Video yourself performing the passages, according to the instructions above
- Name those videos "YOURLASTNAME - name of collection". (You can also perform them in a single video.)
- Upload video(s) to your submissions folder on Google Drive

These are due *perfect or nearly so* by the end of Unit II (week 15). However, please do your best to submit at least a first attempt by **Tuesday, April 1.** This will ensure that you have time to seek help or revise your videos if necessary. Please see me during office hours if you are having difficulty.
