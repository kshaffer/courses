### Project details ###

For your final assessment, select one of the two songs above, and analyze its text, its formal structure, any other musical factors you find interesting or appropriate, and the relationship between the text and music. Based on your analysis, form a single big claim (a thesis statement) that can be supported by evidence in the music and text. Then write an analytical paper of **no more than 1200 words** (about 4–5 pages double-spaced) that argues that claim with that evidence. Be sure to have a valid thesis statement and a clear argument based on evidence, to use musical terminology appropriately, and to follow the *Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed.* 

(N.B.: this means things like cover pages and, if appropriate, a references/works cited page. Also, note that CMoS covers more than just citations; peruse it for proper use of punctuation, hyphens/dashes, and how to refer to musical terms, titles, and the like.)

If you are happy with your results from Assessments 1–3 (see your grade report in GDrive), you need only submit a paper. If you still want/need to demonstrate mastery (i.e., pass) for any of the form objectives, please submit a detailed timeline analysis of your project song.

### Submission ###

In order to conserve paper and make these projects easier to assess and provide feedback, please submit via Google Drive. Create a new Google Document, name the file "LASTNAME Final Paper MT4", and share the file with me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu). Please *do not* put the file in a folder already shared with me and send me a link; instead share the new file with me. (Though you can put it wherever you want in your own GDrive folders.) This is necessary in order for me to keep track of them, and to easily share them with Laura, so we can collaborate on the assessment. If you have any questions about the process, please let me know.

### Assessment ###

This project will assess all of the concepts for this unit (below). 

Analytical concepts:

- identify and interpret **large-scale song forms** (strophic, AABA, verse-chorus).  
- identify and interpret **formal cycles** (start/end times and cycle types—A, AABA, VC, VPC, etc.).  
- identify and interpret **formal modules** (start/end times and module functions—verse, chorus, strophe, bridge, etc.).  
- identify and interpret **formal phrases** (start/end times and phrase types—statement, response, departure, conclusion, blues-tonic, blues-subdominant, blues-dominant, etc.).  
- identify standard **harmonic schemata** in pop/rock songs.  
- articulate the **theme** of a song's text.  
- articulate the way that the formal and/or harmonic structure of a song **supports or works against the theme** of its text.

Writing skills:

- articulate an **original thesis** based on evidence (i.e., musical analysis).  
- construct a clear, linear **argument** in support of a thesis and devoid of unnecessary details.  
- use **musical terminology** appropriately and effectively.  
- write and cite sources, as appropriate to the topic, consistent with the ***Chicago Manual of Style***, 16th ed.
