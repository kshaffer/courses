## Unit I keyboard portfolio instructions ##

To help you familizarize yourselves with standard modulations in classical themes, as well as to connect the sound of those modulations with notation and the feel of them in your hands, you will practice and record yourself performing the following two classical themes at the keyboard:

- [Mozart, K. 330, mvt. II, mm. 1–8.]({{ root_url }}/materials/Mozart330-slowMvtTheme.pdf)  
- [Beethoven, Op. 2/1, mvt. III, mm. 1–14.]({{ root_url }}/materials/Beethoven-Op2-1-minuetTheme.pdf)

You can play them as slow as you like, but play them accurately and with a steady tempo. You can leave out grace notes in your performance if they cause you difficulty performing.

To record and submit these videos, do the following:

- Log in to [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) (using your CU account - same as Google Plus)
- Create a folder named "YOURLASTNAME Submissions (2131)"
- Share the folder with me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu), giving me privileges to comment (or edit, if you’re comfortable)
- Practice the passages above (only the measure numbers listed)
- Video yourself performing the passages, according to the instructions above
- Name those videos "YOURLASTNAME Mozart 330 theme" and "YOURLASTNAME Beethoven Op 2/1 theme"
- Upload those videos to your submissions folder on Google Drive

These are due *perfect or nearly so* by the end of Unit I (week 7 or 8). However, please do your best to submit at least a first attempt by week 4. This will ensure that you have time to seek help or revise your videos if necessary, as well as ensuring that your practice can help develop your ability to hear these modulating patterns before the end of the sonata unit in Music Theory IV. Please see me during office hours if you are having difficulty.
