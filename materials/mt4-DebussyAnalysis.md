In class on Wednesday, March 5, try to answer the following questions (first as an individual, then in a group of 2–3, finally as a whole class):

- In what key (if any) does the piece begin?  
- In what key (if any) does the piece end?  
- Where do you *hear* new formal sections beginning? (Let your ear guide you, but use the score to determine bar numbers.)  
- Where is the climax of the movement?  
- Why all the parallel fifths?!  
- Can you find one or two non-diatonic pitch collections? Which collection? Where in the piece? (bar numbers)  
- To what does the title refer? (This one may need to wait until after class.)  

Then, before Monday's class (March 10), read the [Wikipedia page on this movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_cathédrale_engloutie). Identify one or two things about the piece that are either missing, incomplete, incorrect, or lacking in nuance on that page. We will discuss in class on Monday, in the hopes of finding a few improvments we can make to the page as a class.

Have fun! This is a beautiful piece of music.
