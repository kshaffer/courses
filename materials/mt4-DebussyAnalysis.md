author: Kris Shaffer

## {{ page.title }} ##

Claude Debussy, Préludes, Book 1, X. "La cathédrale engloutie": [score]({{ root_url }}/materials/Debussy-preludes-1-10.pdf).

In class on Wednesday, March 5, try to answer the following questions (first as an individual, then in a group of 2–3, finally as a whole class):

- In what key (if any) does the piece begin?  
- In what key (if any) does the piece end?  
- Where do you *hear* new formal sections beginning? (Let your ear guide you, but use the score to determine bar numbers.)  
- Where is the climax of the movement?  
- Why all the parallel fifths?!  
- Can you find one or two non-diatonic pitch collections? Which collection? Where in the piece? (bar numbers)  
- Can you identify a common melodic pattern Debussy uses at cadences?  
- To what does the title refer? (This one may need to wait until after class.)  

**Before the end of class**, leave one comment on the [Google Plus post for this activity](https://plus.google.com/112120443955741204467/posts/jjuCwAK4bPr) (link will only work if you're logged in to your CU account—it is on the class community page) with an analytical insight you gained today. Please do *not* leave an insight about this piece, but an insight about the analytical process that you can apply when analyzing another piece or style of music.

Then, **before Monday's class (March 10)**, read the [Wikipedia page on this movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_cathédrale_engloutie). Identify one or two things about the piece that are either missing, incomplete, incorrect, or lacking in nuance on that page. We will discuss in class on Monday, in the hopes of finding a few improvments we can make to the page as a class.

Have fun! This is a beautiful piece of music.
