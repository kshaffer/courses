For **Monday, April 7, 10am**, please do the following:

Listen to "Kansas City" by Wilbert Harrison and "I Want to Hold Your Hand" by the Beatles. Audio files for both songs are in the class shared folder on Google Drive. (Please download to your device before listening. If too many people access the files repeatedly in the shared folder, Google will lock it down and prohibit access.)

For each song, construct a timeline analysis of the song's form. You may do so on a paper timeline, or using Variations Audio Timeliner.

For [paper timelines](http://courses.shaffermusic.com/materials/timeline-blank.pdf), bracket phrases and modules (as we did with classical themes), and label them as discussed in the [Pop/rock form resource](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/popRockForm.html) (capital letters for modules according to function—I, O, A, B, etc.—and lower-case letters showing musical relationships—aa'b, srdc, etc.). Then label each cycle in curly brackets at the beginning of the cycle, and write the name of the overall song form at the top of the (first) page of the timeline. Here is [an example timeline analysis]({{ root_url }}/materials/charlieBrown.pdf) of "Charlie Brown" by The Coasters.

If using Variations Audio Timeliner, follow the instructions in [this video](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/VAT.html) and be sure to create layers for phrases, modules, cycles, and the overall song form, and label them as discussed in the [Pop/rock form resource](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/popRockForm.html) (capital letters for modules according to function—I, O, A, B, etc.—and lower-case letters showing musical relationships—aa'b, srdc, etc.). Make sure the file is named "LASTNAME - Song Title", and then upload it to Google Drive and share it with me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu). Provided you used the audio file I provided, you do not need to upload the audio, only the .v2t file.

This is the first of three take-home assessments, and it covers the following four assessment categories:

- large-scale song forms  
- formal cycles  
- formal modules  
- formal phrases
