### Monday ###

I will be out for a funeral on Monday. Laura will collect your assignments and lead the class through two activities.

First, there will be a quiz on pop/rock harmonic schemas. You will hear several excerpts, two times each, and identify the harmonic schema in the excerpt. The schemas are listed [here](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/popRockHarmony.html). I recommend having the resource open during the quiz.

Second, in groups of 2â€“3 students (please, no one working alone during class), attempt to identify the theme of the following two songs' lyrics. (You may want to review last semester's ["Analyzing poetry"](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/analyzingPoetry.html) resource.) Once you have an idea what you think the theme is, comment on [the G+ post](https://plus.google.com/events/cfibdbg2dmpapt5ga5rdjb05720) with your theme. Only one group member needs to comment, but include everyone's names, so we know whom to respond to in discussion.

Otis Redding, "Try a Little Tenderness": [lyrics](http://rock.rapgenius.com/Otis-redding-try-a-little-tenderness-lyrics) | [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXmLjbTBcdU)  
Kanye West & Jay-Z, "Otis": [lyrics](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-otis-lyrics) | [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoEKWtgJQAU)

*Please note there are some explicit lyrics in this song, but it is fairly mild for the genre.*

Feel free to look at the RapGenius annotations for "Otis" if you have difficulty understanding the lyrics.

### For Wednesday ###

[Read each other's attempts at a theme](https://plus.google.com/events/cfibdbg2dmpapt5ga5rdjb05720) for these songs and *+1* or reply as appropriate. Then read [a short blog post](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/03/jay-z-and-kanye-west-a-response-to-ethan-hein/) I wrote this spring about these two songs. Lastly, based on your analysis and my blog post (or your disagreement with my blog post), come up with a single-sentence thesis statement for a hypothetical analysis of "Otis." We will discuss these thesis statements and the supporting analyses in class on Wednesday. (In preparation for your final paper, which will be on a different song.)
