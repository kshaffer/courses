## {{ page.title }} ##

This is the final quiz for Unit I.

Download a score and find a recording for Mozart's Piano Sonata in C major, K. 309, first movement and Mozart's String Quartet in B-flat major, K. 458, first movement.  

After listening and studying these movements, as well as exploring the exposition analyses I provided to you (on the [Unit I guide]({{ root_url }}/mt4-unit1.html)), label the following on the score or on [a timeline]({{ root_url }}/materials/timeline-blank.pdf):  
- Cadences and keys (I:PAC, V:IAC, III:HC, etc.)  
- Structural points of arrival (medial caesura, essential expositional closure, essential sonata closure, crux)  
- Theme-level modules (primary, transition, secondary, closing, TR=>FS, retransition)  
- Movement-level modules (exposition, development, recapitulation, introduction, coda)  
- Correspondence/reference/altered measures, according to the following method:

> For each bar in the recapitulation, if it is a correspondence measure, write above it the measure number it corresponds to in the exposition. If it is a reference measure, write the number of the bar in the exposition it refers to, followed by "ref". If it is an altered (or new) measure, write "alt" above it.

You may use any written/video/audio resources I have provided, but you may not consult other people while working on this assessment. (You are free to review materials not related to these two pieces with your colleages *before* starting the quiz, of course.)

On each score/timeline, reaffirm the honor code by writing "I hereby reaffirm the CU Honor Code" (or simply "IHRTCUHC") and signing your name. No quiz will be accepted and assessed without the honor code statement.

This quiz is due by **the beginning of class on Monday, Feb. 24**. It will cover (and assess) the following course objectives:

- Cadences (PAC, IAC, HC)  
- Exposition and recapitulation types (continuous, two-part, two-part with multiple MCs)  
- Modulations  
- Structural points of arrival (medial caesura, essential expositional closure, essential sonata closure, crux)  
- Theme-level modules (primary, transition, secondary, closing, TR=>FS, retransition)  
- Movement-level modules (exposition, development, recapitulation, introduction, coda)  
- Correspondence, reference, and altered measures  

Good luck!
