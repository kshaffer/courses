For **Monday, April 21, 10am**, please do the following:

Listen to ["Downtown" by Petula Clark](http://open.spotify.com/track/0hgWgToJgb7O1tT12YWRCz) (spotify:track:0hgWgToJgb7O1tT12YWRCz) and ["Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners](http://open.spotify.com/track/0EMmVUYs9ZZRHtlADB88uz) (spotify:track:0EMmVUYs9ZZRHtlADB88uz).

For each song, construct a timeline analysis of the song's form. You may do so on a paper timeline, or using Variations Audio Timeliner.

For [paper timelines](http://courses.shaffermusic.com/materials/timeline-blank.pdf), bracket phrases and modules (as we did with classical themes), and label them as discussed in the [Pop/rock form resource](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/popRockForm.html) (capital letters for modules according to function—I, O, A, B, etc.—and lower-case letters showing musical relationships—aa'b, srdc, etc.). Then label each cycle in curly brackets at the beginning of the cycle, and write the name of the overall song form at the top of the (first) page of the timeline. 

If using Variations Audio Timeliner, follow the instructions in [this video](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/VAT.html) and be sure to create layers for phrases, modules, cycles, and the overall song form, and label them as discussed in the [Pop/rock form resource](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/popRockForm.html) (capital letters for modules according to function—I, O, A, B, etc.—and lower-case letters showing musical relationships—aa'b, srdc, etc.). Make sure the file is named "LASTNAME - Song Title", and then upload it to Google Drive and share it with me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu). Provided you used the audio file I provided, you do not need to upload the audio, only the .v2t file.

As always, you are encouraged to study together, but assessments should be completed individually (though you may consult written resources as you work). Please affirm the CU Honor Code on your assignment when submitting ("IHRTCUHC" and sign your name).

This is the third of three take-home timeline assessments, and it covers the following four assessment categories:

- large-scale song forms  
- formal cycles  
- formal modules  
- formal phrases
