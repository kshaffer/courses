Analyze the sonata structure of the following two movements (audio is in the class GDrive shared folder under [Sonata Timelines](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cLWhieUx0WTN4YUk&usp=sharing)):

- [Beethoven, Piano Sonata, Op. 49, No. 1, first movement](http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/c/c8/IMSLP51743-PMLP01471-Beethoven_Werke_Breitkopf_Serie_16_No_142_Op_49_No_1.pdf)  
- [Haydn, Symphony No. 2, first movement](http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/c/c8/IMSLP31269-PMLP71226-Haydn-_Sinfonia_Nr2__HCR_Landon_.pdf)

After listening and studying these movements, as well as exploring the model analyses I provided to you (on the [Unit III guide]({{ root_url }}/mt3-unit3.html)), make a timeline (using Variations Audio Timeline or [paper]({{ root_url }}/materials/timeline-blank.pdf):  

- Structural points of arrival (medial caesura, essential expositional closure, essential sonata closure, crux)  
- Theme-level modules (primary, transition, secondary, closing, TR=>FS, retransition)  
- Movement-level modules (exposition, development, recapitulation, introduction, coda)  
- Exposition types (two-part, continuous, or multiple-MCs) â€“ note that both pieces have different exposition types

If you have not yet passed one or more of the concepts for [Unit II](mt3-unit2.html), you may add them to the timeline *for the P themes of each piece only*:

- Cadences and keys (I:PAC, V:IAC, III:HC, etc.)  
- sub-phrases (basic ideas, contrasting ideas)  
- phrases (presentation, continuation, antecedent, consequent, compound basic idea)  
- themes (sentences, periods, hybrid themes, compound themes)  

If you have yet to pass harmony, please print out the scores *for the P themes only* and label all chords with Roman numerals and figured bass, interpreting them with T/S/D labels.  

You may use any written/video/audio resources I have provided, but you may not consult other people while working on this assessment. (You are free to review materials not related to these two pieces with your colleages *before* starting the quiz, of course.)

On each score/timeline, reaffirm the honor code by writing/typing "I hereby reaffirm the CU Honor Code" (or simply "IHRTCUHC") and signing your name (if paper). No quiz will be accepted and assessed without the honor code statement.

This quiz is due by **the beginning of class on Wednesday, December 10**. 

Good luck!
