Stravinsky: *Three Pieces for String Quartet*:  [score](http://imslp.org/wiki/3_Pieces_for_String_Quartet_(Stravinsky,_Igor)) (This *is* public domain in the US.)

In class on Wednesday, March 12, try to answer the following questions (first as an individual, then in a group of 2–3, finally as a whole class):

- Each part (Violin I, Violin II, Viola, Cello) has a repeated pattern. How many beats long is each voice's pattern?  
- Three of the four parts line up their beginnings in m. 4 (note that Violin II is playing the note for the Viola's part). When do these parts line up again? If they don't line up again in this movement, how long would the movement have to be for them to line up again?  
- Which of the patterns dictate(s) the time signatures?  
- What is the musical effect of these overlapping rhythmic patterns?

**Before the end of class**, leave one comment on the [Google Plus post for this activity](https://plus.google.com/112120443955741204467/posts/BLEq5LkiyCP) (link will only work if you're logged in to your CU account—it is on the class community page) with an analytical insight you gained today. Please do *not* leave an insight about this piece, but an insight about the analytical process that you can apply when analyzing another piece or style of music.

Then, **before Monday's class (March 17)**, write a one-paragaph analytical response in your Google Doc. Focus on rhythm/meter, secondary parameters (orchestration, dynamics, articulation, etc.), and attempting to tie it together with a single thesis statement.
