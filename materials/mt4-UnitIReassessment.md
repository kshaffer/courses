# {{ page.title }}

Please check your grade report in Google Drive. If you are content with the letter grade you currently have (keeping in mind what the [syllabus]({{ root_url }}/theory4.html) says about final grade calculation), you can do nothing and ignore the remainder of this post.

## Reassessment

If you would like to improve your Unit I grade, consult your assessment report and do the following:

- **Identify the category/categories that you would like to reassess.** Generally speaking, these will be categories that you have passed on one assessment already.  
- **Identify a piece we have covered this semester that will provide for a good reassessment opportunity.** You cannot reassess an analysis you have already passed, so make sure this is a piece you have yet to pass an assessment on for the category/categories in question. If you are reassessing multiple categories, it is preferable (but not required) to choose a single piece that will cover all of them.  
- **Choose one of the following reassessment options that best fits your situation.** *If you have to reassess three or more categories, you are required to do an oral exam.*  
- Then **submit your reassessment by Thursday, March 19, 3p.m.** All paper revisions, written submissions, and/or oral exams must be completed/submitted by that time, or they will not count. 

Use [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/forms/d/1URJxv5V58db81mWlMB4mlIhr9fqCAfFEXsTRmmpKJnU/viewform?usp=send_form) for all written reassessment submissions (including both Twitter essays and paragraph analyses).

**Option I: Paper revisions**

If you wrote a Unit I paper, and if a revision of analytical details in your paper will provide the second analysis needed to pass the category in question, use those revisions as your reassessment. I have left comments in your paper's Google Doc if this is the case for you.

**Option II: Twitter essay**

If you are reassessing a single category, and you are confident that you can artiulate the necessary information in 140 characters, submit a Twitter essay using the form linked above. That Twitter essay should explain how the significant musical structural elements in the piece you have chosen supports the meaning of the song. This will count towards your total of three Twitter essays for the semester.

**Option III: Written analysis**

If you do not think that you can express a high enough level of analytical insight in a single Twitter essay, or if you have to reassess more than one category, you may submit a written analysis. For each reassessment category, write *a single paragraph (200 words maximum)* explaining how the significant musical structural elements in the piece you have chosen supports the meaning of the song. Be sure to explain the meaning of the song *even if you have passed the text-music relationships category*. (If text-music relationships is one of the concepts you need to reassess, your other paragraph(s) will cover that; there is no need to write an additional text-music relationships paragraph.)

**Option IV: Oral exam**

If you are more comfortable assessing in person, or need to reassess three or more categories, sign up for an oral exam. In this exam, you will have roughly 5 minutes to present your analysis, and during the remainder of the time I will ask you questions about the piece you chose. For the most part, these questions will be aimed at helping you articulate analytical details that you left out of your "presentation." Come prepared with as much analytical information as possible about the piece, and (as in the written analysis options) be sure to explain how the musical details you find relate to the meaning of the song.
