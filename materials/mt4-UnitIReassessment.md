## {{ page.title }} ##

Please check your grade report in Google Drive. Current Unit I grades are as follows:

- B: 9 or 10 concepts passing  
- C: 7 or 8 concepts passing  
- D: 5 or 6 concepts passing  
- F: 4 or fewer concepts passing

If you are content with the letter grade you currently have (keeping in mind what the [syllabus]({{ root_url }}/theory4.html) says about final grade calculation), you can do nothing and ignore the remainder of this post.

If you have a B (9 or 10 concepts passing), you are eligible to do the A-level project, described below.

If you have a C, D, or F (8 or less concepts passing), you are eligible to do the reassessment, described below.

**All A-level projects and reassessments are due by the beginning of class on Monday, March 10.**

### A-level project ###

Find a sonata-form movement with complex or ambiguous features. Following are two to choose from, but you may pick your own, if you have one you would like to study.

- Mozart, Symphony No. 35 in D Major, "Haffner," K. 385, first movement  
- Beethoven, Symphony No. 2 in D Major, Op. 36, first movement  

For your movement, Produce a timeline or annotated score (like in the quizzes) accurately labeling all elements in that movement listed for [Sonata Quiz 3]({{ root_url }}/materials/mt4-sonataQuiz3.html).

Write a short paper (800 words maximum) or produce a short video (5 minutes maximum) explaining ambiguous elements in the movementâ€”either the thought process that went into choosing the labels you chose on your timeline for ambiguous passages, or explaining the musical significance of complex elements that resisted clear timeline labels.

Please compose your paper as a single Google Document or upload your video to Google Drive, and share it with me (kris DOT shaffer AT colorado DOT edu). You may submit timelines/annotated scores digitally (scan and upload to GDrive) or manually (in class), your choice.

### Reassessment ###

If you have an **N (not attempted)** for any of the Unit I concepts, you must talk to me individually if you want a chance to reassess those. Please do so immediately.

For any concepts that you have an **A (attempted)**, compare the quizzes you took with the key distributed in class or on the [Unit I Guide]({{ root_url }}/mt4-unit1.html). Write a single paragraph explaining either why the analysis in the key is preferable, or why the key is incorrect and your analysis makes more sense. You need not do this for every difference between your analyses and the keys, but for enough to demonstrate that you understand the concept.

Please compose your written responses in a single Google Document, and share it with me (kris DOT shaffer AT colorado DOT edu).

If you are missing any of the old quizzes, or if you feel that a written response will not sufficiently demonstrate your understanding, please talk to me. I'm willing to offer alternatives, if they are mutually agreeable and they are arranged *early*.

Any concepts sufficiently explained will merit changing that concept's assessment from **A** to **P**. Final unit grades will be assigned according to the same scale as above.
