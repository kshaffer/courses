[Here are scores]({{ root_url }}/materials/Feb10.pdf) for the three sonata expositions analyzed in class on Monday, February 10 (Mozart, K. 281, I.; Beethoven, Op. 2/3, I.; and Haydn Symphony 3, I.). These scores contain my analytical annotations for their sonata structure. 

Following is a Spotify playlist with recordings of all three pieces.
