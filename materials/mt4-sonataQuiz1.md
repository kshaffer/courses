## {{ page.title }} ##

This quiz is due by the beginning of class on Monday, Feb. 10. It will cover (and assess) the following course objectives:

- Structural points of arrival (medial caesura, essential expositional closure, essential sonata closure, crux)  
- Theme-level modules (primary, transition, secondary, closing, TR=>FS, retransition)  
- Movement-level modules (exposition, development, recapitulation, introduction, coda)  
- Cadences (PAC, IAC, HC)  

Please do the following:

- Download a score and find a recording for Mozart's Piano Sonata in C major, K. 545, first movement and Beethoven's "easy" Piano Sonata in G major, Op. 49, No. 2, first movement.  
- After listening and studying these movements, label the following on the score or on [a timeline]({{ root_url }}/materials/timeline-blank.pdf):  
  - P, TR, S, and C (if present) *in the exposition only*  
  - MC and EEC *in the exposition only*  
  - exposition, development, and recapitulation  
  - all cadences in the exposition with key and cadence type (I:IAC, III:PAC, etc.)

You may use any written/video/audio resources I have provided, but you may not consult other people while working on this assessment. (You are free to review materials not related to these two pieces with your colleages *before* starting the quiz, of course.)

On each score/timeline, reaffirm the honor code by writing "I hereby reaffirm the CU Honor Code" (or simply "IHRTCUHC") and signing your name. No quiz will be accepted and assessed without the honor code statement.

Good luck!
