You will be provided with a key, a meter, and a chain of 2–3 schemata that can be used as the underpinning of an 8-bar *non-modulating* sentence. For example:

- Meyer – 5-stage Prinner  
- Aprile – Passo Indietro – Compound HC

Then you will be given roughly one minute to think through options. Following that, inform your instructor which grade-level you are aiming for (see [Unit II Guide](as3-unit2.html)), then count off an appropriate tempo for your melody. Your instructor will accompany you with the appropriate harmonic progression for your schema chain, while you improvise a melody over it without stopping. 

If your melody fits the schemas provided *and* follows the mold of a sentence (two melodically related basic ideas followed by continuation material and an appropriate cadence), and meets the complexity level of the grade level you chose, you will receive that grade.

Since you have a second attempt later in the unit, you are more than welcome to attempt a lower grade level for practice and to ensure at least a medium grade for the unit. You may also attempt a higher grade and, if successful, you will not need the second attempt.

You may perform by singing with solfège or playing on an instrument of your choice.

All schemas will be chosen from those on the [schema summary page on OMT](http://openmusictheory.com/schemataSummary.html), and there is both instructional material and play-along audio for practice on the [Improvising a sentence](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) page.

Good luck!
