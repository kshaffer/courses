# Proposal for syllabus changes

I would like to propose two changes to the syllabus. Neither of these will change the content of the course, nor will they significantly change the standard required to pass the course with various grades. They *will*, however, provide some additional flexibility regarding how you demonstrate fleuncy in the musical concepts and skills we are exploring this semester. I would like to propose these changes to the class and ask you all to vote on them. The decision of the simple majority will stand.

## Proposal 1: assessment 

As the [syllabus](theory1.html) currently stands, *all* 20 fundamentals concepts must be passed to get a D or higher in the course. In other words, none of the species or keyboard harmony work "counts" until all quizzes are passed. This made sense at the beginning of the semester, when I was requiring all of them to be passed before Unit II began. However, it became clear that that was an undue burden on many of you, and that it was musically unnecessary for us to proceed on to a study of species counterpoint. Thus, there is now a question of fairness in my mind. Is it more fair to stick to the syllabus put forward at the beginning of the semester, or is it more fair to change the assessment scheme to better match how we are progressing through our musical studies?

I propose a change whereby we require roughly the same *number* of concepts to receive a D, C, B, or A, but remove the requirements surrounding *which* concepts those must be. In other words, 20 concepts would still need to be passed to earn a D, but it could be a mix of fundamentals and counterpoint, for example. 

Here's the scheme I propose, based on a total of 40 concepts (if you count major and minor versions of each species and four-part scheme as two separate concepts to pass).

- 36 concepts passed: A  
- 31 concepts passed: B  
- 26 concepts passed: C  
- 20 concepts passed: D

(This puts an A– at 90%, D– exactly where it is now, and equally spaces B and C between them. This makes it *slightly* easier to get an A, B, or C, but not much.)

This change would help those of you struggling with speed on some of these concepts, but not struggling in applying those concepts in your composing and performing. For example, you could get credit for composing counterpoint exercises that contain a proper use of intervals, even if you do not reach the necessary level of speed to pass a timed interval ID quiz. (Only those who pass both the quiz and the counterpoint would get credit for both, of course.)

## Proposal 2: half-credit quizzes

November 4 is the last day for timed quizzes on all fundamentals objectives (except for triads, seventh chords, and Roman numerals). I will be off-campus on November 6 and was planning on a break between units. However, I propose that on November 6, Ashley administer a class-long "quiz" that includes any concepts that some people have not passed yet. You can take the entire class time to demonstrate understanding of these concepts. But this "untimed quiz" would only count for half-credit. (This would not negate the one-shot reassessment policy in the syllabus, but would be in addition to that.)

This is, of course, dependent on Proposal 1 being approved, as the syllabus currently requires *full credit* for all fundamentals quizzes in order to receive a D or higher.

(Students who have passed all with full credit by the 4th could simply stay home on the 6th, if we did this.)

## Voting

Please vote on the following form by Thursday, October 30. You will have an opportunity to ask questions about this via email or in class on Tuesday. If it is clear, and you know what you want to do, you can vote right away. Note that I am asking for names simply as a backup, in case it looks like something went wrong with the voting. (I want to make sure it is fair.) When I download the results, I will look at names separate from the votes, in case it looks like there is a software error (votes registered more than once), or something like that.

Thanks! And choose wisely.
