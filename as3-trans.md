The ability to transcribe a complex musical texture into performable notation is an important professional skill for musicians. It is also a process that pushes your ear (and your musical mind) in ways that simply performing, analyzing, or even dictating, music cannot. Thus a major portion of this Aural Skills unit focuses on the transcription of songs of moderate complexity, the detection of errors in your own and in others' transcriptions, and finally the performance of these songs reading from the transcriptions.

**Course objective/assessment standard:** Transcribe all pitched elements of a pop/rock song of moderate complexity (from the [syllabus](auralskills3.html)). 

This objective will be met via a major transcription project, loosely due during Week 5 of the semester. Your transcriptions should include:

- all vocal parts  
- bass line  
- chord symbols (lead sheet and Roman numerals) for chord progressions  
- all instrumental lines

*Note: you do not need to transcribe every note played by a chordal instrument (piano block chords, guitar strums), only the instruments that play melodic or counter-melodic lines.*

Transcriptions should be done in music notation software and should be performance-ready. 

In order to pass the assessment objective, multiple members of the class (the exact number will be determined by your section instructor) must examine it and approve it. The standard you all should apply in evaluating each other's transcriptions is *Could I perform in public from this transcription without fixing errors in it myself?* (Note that you will do just that—though not in public—for your subsequent class project.) Only when multiple class members have approved a transcription will the instructor assess it officially. (Your instructor will be available, of course, for feedback throughout the transcription process in class and during office hours.)

You may choose one of the following songs, or select your own song *to be approved by your instructor*. Your transcription must include moderately complex syncopated rhythms and some representation of "voice-leading"/"counterpoint" (multiple voices or instruments performing simultaneously). Exemplars of harmonic schemas covered in class is also good, but not required.

Song possibilities:

- ["Somebody Told Me,"](http://open.spotify.com/track/7HGTkn2aX7MNdKs7nV2xBt) The Killers (tough bass part, but otherwise fairly straightforward)  
- ["Without Me,"](http://open.spotify.com/track/0dANBArhOxOMg86yF1yqNQ) Kina Grannis (relatively easy bass & chords, but includes both background vocals and strings)  
- ["So Right,"](http://open.spotify.com/track/2mb0QZ1XtxUB82ziBCVtNY) Dave Matthews Band (rather "bluesy" vocals and instrumental solos—i.e., lots of pitch bends)  
- ["God Only Knows,"](http://open.spotify.com/track/6iGU74CwXuT4XVepjc9Emf) The Beach Boys (syncopated compound meter, small background orchestra, substantial vocal counterpoint near end of song)

Any other songs *must be approved by your instructor by the end of Week 3*.
