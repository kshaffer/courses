Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## September 11 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **clefs** – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  
- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  
- **major scales** – write major scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **minor scales** – write minor scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch writing** – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

These quizzes will be *electronic* (using [Socrative](http://socrative.com)). Please bring a web-friendly device. If you cannot, or if you would prefer paper, contact me by noon on Monday, and I will print you a paper quiz.

After the quizzes, we will do some work on the concept of scale degrees, and the application of that concept in transposition. (This will prepare you for quizzes next week on **scale-degree ID** and **transposition.**) To prepare, please read the following resource from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com):

- [Scales and scale degrees](http://openmusictheory.com/scales.html)

This may also be helpful to prepare for scale- and pitch-writing quizzes on the 10th.

Additionally, (re-)read any resources on OMT that may be helpful in your quiz preparation, and/or visit [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com) for practice exercises.

## September 9 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **meter** – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).  
- **time signatures** – write the appropriate time signature given a specified meter.  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch ID** – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

These quizzes will be *electronic* (using [Socrative](http://socrative.com)). Please bring a web-friendly device. If you cannot, or if you would prefer paper, contact me by noon on Monday, and I will print you a paper quiz.

After the quizzes, we will follow up on our recent study of meter by exploring its implications for rhythmic notation. To prepare, please read the following two resources from Open Music Theory:

- [Rhythmic values](http://openmusictheory.com/rhythmicValues.html)  
- [Protonotation](http://openmusictheory.com/protonotation.html)

Additionally, (re-)read any resources on OMT that may be helpful in your quiz preparation, and/or visit [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com) for practice exercises.

## September 4 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **meter** – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).

- **clefs** – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  

Prepare for these quizzes by reviewing materials on [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com), performing practice exercises on [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com), and/or drilling/discussing with a classmate.

Please bring a pencil (or two) and a web-enabled device to class.

## September 2 prep

There will be no quizzes on Tuesday, September 2 (see Sep 4 prep for Thursday's quizzes). Instead, we will discuss the [Open Letter](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-letter-students/) I shared with you last week, and solidify understanding of meter.

*Please be sure to bring a web-enabled device to class.*

## August 28 prep

Read the following and come to class with any questions you have.

- [Syllabus](theory1.html)  
- [Unit I Guide](mt1-unit1.html)  
- ["An Open Letter to My Students"](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-letter-students/)  

Those interested in following up on the "Tritone Paradox" can [read more about it here.](http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=206)

Also, come prepared for the following *timed* quizzes at the beginning of class. Use the readings at [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com) to help you prepare, if necessary.
