Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## September 18 quizzes

Quizzes will include **meter ID**, **time signature writing**, **rhythmic notation**, and possibly others (based on 9/16 quiz results). 

## September 16 prep

We will begin class with *four* quizzes: one 1-minute quiz, one 1.5-minute quiz, and two 3-minute quizzes. Choose which of the following you will prepare to pass.

Choose *one* of the following 1-minute quizzes:

- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch ID** – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

Choose *one* of the following 1.5-minute quizzes:

- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  

Choose *two* of the following 3-minute quizzes:

- **pitch writing** – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **major scales** – write major scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **minor scales** – write minor scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

Since Socrative does not support multiple quizzes simultaneously in the same online "classroom" (that I know of), all of these quizzes will be paper-based.

We will spend the remainder of class focusing on rhythmic notation. To prepare, *attempt to translate the protonotation rhythms in [the worksheet from class](materials/protoToRhythm.pdf) to staff notation, according to the instructions provided.*

It may be helpful to review the following resources from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com):

- [Rhythmic values](http://openmusictheory.com/rhythmicValues.html)  
- [Protonotation](http://openmusictheory.com/protonotation.html)


## September 11 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **clefs** – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  
- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  
- **major scales** – write major scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **minor scales** – write minor scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch writing** – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

These quizzes will be *paper-based*. Please bring a pencil (or two, just in case).

After the quizzes, we will revisit protonotation and rhythmic notation. Please finish the first page (staff notation to protonotation) of the worksheet we began on the 9th and bring it to class. Also, please review the following resources from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com):

- [Rhythmic values](http://openmusictheory.com/rhythmicValues.html)  
- [Protonotation](http://openmusictheory.com/protonotation.html)

It is absolutely essential that you read these resources and come ready to apply them, and with specific questions about things that you don't understand.

Additionally, (re-)read any resources on OMT that may be helpful in your quiz preparation, and/or visit [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com) for practice exercises.

## September 9 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **meter** – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).  
- **time signatures** – write the appropriate time signature given a specified meter.  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch ID** – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

These quizzes will be *electronic* (using [Socrative](http://socrative.com)). Please bring a web-friendly device. If you cannot, or if you would prefer paper, contact me by noon on Monday, and I will print you a paper quiz.

After the quizzes, we will follow up on our recent study of meter by exploring its implications for rhythmic notation. To prepare, please read the following two resources from Open Music Theory:

- [Rhythmic values](http://openmusictheory.com/rhythmicValues.html)  
- [Protonotation](http://openmusictheory.com/protonotation.html)

Additionally, (re-)read any resources on OMT that may be helpful in your quiz preparation, and/or visit [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com) for practice exercises.

## September 4 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **meter** – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).  
- **time signatures** – write the appropriate time signature given a specified meter.  
- **clefs** – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  

Prepare for these quizzes by reviewing materials on [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com), performing practice exercises on [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com), and/or drilling/discussing with a classmate.

Please bring a pencil (or two) and a web-enabled device to class.

## September 2 prep

There will be no quizzes on Tuesday, September 2 (see Sep 4 prep for Thursday's quizzes). Instead, we will discuss the [Open Letter](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-letter-students/) I shared with you last week, and solidify understanding of meter.

*Please be sure to bring a web-enabled device to class.*

## August 28 prep

- [Syllabus](theory1.html)  
- [Unit I Guide](mt1-unit1.html)  
- ["An Open Letter to My Students"](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-letter-students/)  

Those interested in following up on the "Tritone Paradox" can [read more about it here.](http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=206)

Also, come prepared for the following *timed* quizzes at the beginning of class. Use the readings at [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com) to help you prepare, if necessary.
