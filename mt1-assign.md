Quizzes TBA.

Please read [Tendency tones and functional harmonic dissonances](http://openmusictheory.com/tendencyTonesFunctionalDissonances.html), but only the section of *tendency tones*. Do *not* read about functional dissonances yet.

Have a great break!

## November 20 prep

We will begin class with quizzes on **triad ID**, **triad writing**, and **Roman numerals**. The RN quiz will involve writing the appropriate Roman numeral for a chord when given a key and a lead-sheet symbol.

The bulk of class will explore *basso continuo* voice-leading. To prepare, please read the following:

- [the "rules" predicted in class](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1GS7moAnesc3og4YLf-NpbL4xUEt2uYiHrlXAFDTuA8c/edit?usp=sharing)  
- [Composing in *basso continuo* style](http://openmusictheory.com/bassoContinuo.html)  
- [Style and tendency](http://openmusictheory.com/tendency.html)

Then fill out the following form.

## November 18 activity

Based on your knowledge of species counterpoint (two-part voice-leading), chordal structure (triads and seventh chords), and the music that you’ve performed/studied/composed…

What do you predict are the core “rules” of four-part voice-leading?

Keep in mind the following limitations:

There will always be four voices.
All voices will be played on the keyboard—one in the left hand, and three in the right hand.

Organize the “rules” according to the five principles laid out in the [Introduction to strict voice-leading.](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fopenmusictheory.com%2FspeciesIntro.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH3bFlSxXogvnDUDHCQRLLBmnV8NQ)

Have one person in your group serve as the "scribe," taking notes in [this Google doc.](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1GS7moAnesc3og4YLf-NpbL4xUEt2uYiHrlXAFDTuA8c/edit?usp=sharing)

## November 18 prep

This is the last day to submit regular fourth-species assignments and any Unit II reassessments. Be sure to post links to your work on the form below. If they are not posted to the form, they will not be assessed. [This video](https://vimeo.com/111704047) provides directions.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aXRW1ELI_i6VpEEiuop-sGErEj40uORvOBAbehD4BVM/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe><br/>

We will begin class with two quizzes: **triad writing** and **triad ID**. These will be similar in format to (though shorter than) the exercises we did in class on Tuesday. For triad ID, you will be asked to give the proper [lead-sheet symbol](http://openmusictheory.com/Graphics/Handouts/LSandFBsymbols.pdf), including slashes for inversions, for various close-position triads. For triad writing, you will be given lead-sheet symbols and asked to notate those chords. (Treble, alto, and bass clefs are all fair game.)

<!--
In preparation for the remainder of our class time (as well as for the triad ID quiz), finish the [harmonic reduction exercise](materials/reduction-K331.pdf) from Thursday's class. Then compare your analysis with [the key](materials/reduction-K331-key.pdf). Note what is different, and consult the [Triads and seventh chords](http://openmusictheory.com/triads.html) resource or the [Harmonies by bass scale degree handout](http://openmusictheory.com/Graphics/Handouts/HarmoniesByBassScaleDegree.pdf) to figure out why. If questions remain, note them in the form below.
-->

Then read the following resources on OMT:

- [Introduction to thoroughbass](http://openmusictheory.com/thoroughbassFigures.html)  
- [A brief history of basso continuo keyboard-style voice-leading](http://openmusictheory.com/bassoContinuo-history.html)  
- [Generating Roman numerals from a figured bass line](http://openmusictheory.com/RNfromFB.html) (this is more of a reference that can serve you later)

Finally, fill out the form below. Please remember to bring your harmonic reduction score (Mozart, K. 331) from Thursday's class.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QVaDvSJqsThWH0GBOOKczhn3Xa99O373ZWf0QJMEzlo/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe><br/>

## November 13 prep

Finish the [seventh-chords practice worksheet](materials/seventhChordsPractice.pdf) begun in class. Optionally, review the [triads practice worksheet](materials/triadsPractice.pdf) done in class. Review the [Triads and seventh chords](http://openmusictheory.com/triads.html) resource on Open Music Theory, as necessary.

## November 11 prep

Please work with a partner and submit an attempt at fourth-species counterpoint, per the usual procedures. As on November 4, please use the following form to provide a link to each of your submitted videos and pictures.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gZxRICuhnVHIwzX49KZJLk9nLFQSZJ8xpBxUwVA7cbc/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe><br/>

Then, read the [Triads and seventh chords](http://openmusictheory.com/triads.html) resource on Open Music Theory. Come ready to ask questions about the resource, and then to work on building fluency with identifying and notating these chords.

For the first time since August, there is *no quiz!*

## November 6 prep

Check your assessment reports for November 4 quiz updates. For any of the first 15 fundamentals objectives that you have not passed, you will have the opportunity to take an untimed quiz on Thursday to pass them for half-credit. (Though untimed, all materials will still need to be completed by the end of class.) This quiz will include all 15 concepts and follow the same patterns as the timed quizzes. You will have the duration of Thursday's class to pass as many of your outstanding concepts as possible in the alotted time. This quiz will be administered by Ashley, as I will be presenting at a conference.

There is no prep work aside from studying for the quizzes. If you have passed all 15, you need not attend class. If you finish your outstanding objectives before 8:50, you can leave early.

## November 4 prep

***This is the Unit II deadline.*** That means that all species assignments must be submitted by the beginning of class to "count" towards the grade. There will be one reassessment opportunity per concept after Nov 4., but *only for concepts that were attempted by the deadline*. There is one exception: fourth-species counterpoint will have November 11 as its deadline, since we just started exploring that concept.

This is also the last opportunity for timed quizzes for all concepts except triads, seventh chords, and Roman numerals. Specific quizzes will be announced on Friday, October 31, after October 30 quizzes have been graded.

Prep work: 

Complete any outstanding species counterpoint work, especially first and second species. (If you have passed up through second species, you can make an attempt at fourth species.) Once you have completed your work, share it with Ashley and me on Google Drive ***and*** paste the link for each file in the form below. (We've been losing some things in the submission process. This will help us make sure nothing is lost or late.)

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aC1uE5i-PFHywRcXsXjuqkABWhi-4PaNw66TaS4_0XM/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe><br/>

## October 30 prep

We will begin class with three quizzes. Choose from the following: **interval ID**, **interval writing**, **rhythmic notation**, and **minor scales**. If you have passed all of these, feel free to come to class at 8:10.

The bulk of class will be devoted to work on issues related to fourth-species counterpoint composition. To prepare, please do the following:

- Review the [class notes from our collaborative *fourth-species* analysis](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1xTCp8GG8y3v9_ttmJIQlclJMigvU7VvqTe7N_MoHarI/edit?usp=sharing).  
- Read the [Composing a fourth-species counterpoint](http://openmusictheory.com/fourthSpecies.html) resource on OMT. Note the differences between these two resources to enter in the form below.  
- Be sure to watch both videos, as there are some tricky situations in fourth-species, and we will begin wrestling with them in class on Thursday.  
- Do the recomposition exercise at the end of the fourth-species. Copy the link to your solution and paste it in the form below.  
- Fill out the form below.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZmKZFOQ857jL9vNDXlzNoTJsTVYUlKbZEgmCSdcvODU/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe><br/>

Lastly, be sure to bring staff paper, a pencil, and a web-enabled device (phone is fine) to class on Thursday.


## October 28 prep

Please prepare for the following quizzes:

- **transposition** – I will give you a single melody and ask you to transpose it to another key.  
- *one* of the following 1-minute quizzes: **meter ID**, **time signature writing**, or **key signature ID**.  
- *one* of the following 1.5-minute quizzes: **key signature writing**, **pitch ID**, **chromatic scale writing**.

Be sure to consult old quizzes (keys for most are posted on the [Unit I Guide](mt1-unit1.html)) and prepare helpful notes to bring. The deadline for passing these is November 4.

Also, proceed to the next step in your species writing. Either correct errors in something attempted but not passed, or proceed onto the next new species. Do *not* attempt second species until cantus firmus and first species are passed. Submit per the usual arrangement.

## October 23 prep

Quizzes will be **Interval ID** and **Interval writing**. Review the [Intervals](http://openmusictheory.com/intervals.html) resource on OMT as necessary. Interval practice on [teoria.com](http://teoria.com) may also be helpful.

For Thursday's class, please make an initial attempt at second-species composition with a partner. The procedure is the same as first-species: one major, one minor, one above, one below, and use cantus firmi from [the same set](http://openmusictheory.com/Graphics/counterpoint/cantusFirmi.pdf) that you used for first species. Submit via Google Drive, as we have been doing.

If, however, you are behind in passing the cantus firmus or first-species objective(s), please revise those rather than go on to something new (and more complicated) in second species.

## October 21 prep

We will begin with three quizzes. Choose *two* of the following 3-minute quizzes: **major scales**, **minor scales**, or **rhythmic notation**. Also, choose *one* of the following 1-minute quizzes: **time signature writing** or **key signature ID**. Please review old quizzes (on the [Unit I Guide](mt1-unit1.html)) and [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com) as appropriate.

*Note that all quizzes (except for triads, seventh chords, and Roman numerals) must be completed by November 4.*

In addition to preparing for the quizzes, check your assessment report and your species feedback, and revise/complete the next stage in your species composing and performing to submit for Monday. If you are ready to begin second species, the requirements are the same as first species: one major, one minor, one above, one below, and use cantus firmi from the same set that you used for first species.

Finally, bring a web-enabled device to class on Tuesday.

## October 16 prep

We will have quizzes on **interval ID** and **pitch ID**. Since it appears that the big problem remaining on pitch ID is time, I will extend this quiz from 1 minute to 1.5 minutes. The interval ID quiz will be as described in class (and practiced) on Thursday: you will be given a second-species exercise and asked to label all melodic and harmonic intervals (m2, P5, A4, etc.).

The bulk of class will be devoted to work on issues related to second-species counterpoint composition. To prepare, please do the following:

- Review the [class notes from our collaborative *second-species* analysis](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1EOSMdmb9ljGs8AB3sefz-wfFLmVReDGLaGQ4bdl5VbY/edit?usp=sharing).  
- Read the [Composing a second-species counterpoint](http://openmusictheory.com/secondSpecies.html) resource on OMT. Note the differences between these two resources to enter in the form below.  
- Fill out the form below.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1b6qZiG1kZuVniiTa0qUWOaZvUBXOXn5797On2-wVbb8/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe><br/>

Lastly, be sure to bring staff paper, a pencil, and a web-enabled device (phone is fine) to class on Thursday.


## October 14 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on **scale-degree ID.** On this quiz, I will give you two well-formed cantus firmi: one in major, one in minor, each in a different clef. You should then write the solfège syllable for each note in the melodies. I will not tell you what the keys are; you must discern that from the key signature and the first/last notes.

**If you have not passed major and minor cantus firmi,** complete that assessment. (See instructions below.)

**If you have passed major and minor cantus firmi but not major and minor first-species,** complete the first-species assessment. (See instructions below.)

**If you have passed all cantus firmus and first-species objectives,** enjoy the weekend. :)

## October 9 prep

We will begin class with two quizzes. Choose two of the following three concepts to prepare: **time signature writing**, **key signature ID**, and **pitch ID**. Review the resources on OMT as necessary.

Also, please read the Open Music Theory resource on [Intervals](http://openmusictheory.com/intervals.html). 

Then do the following practice exercise, replacing all of the rests with notes that correctly make the harmonic intervals listed. (Note: the musical result will *not* be a well-formed species exercise!)

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/c6089e7eec" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Finally, copy the *link* to your practice exercise and paste it below along with your answer to the question.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/130VACDpj40jEkgRxiiI4M7Hvs-ccdUoAlcCfMMWrFwQ/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe><br/>

## October 7 prep

We will begin class with two quizzes. Choose two of the following concepts to prepare: **rhythmic notation writing**, **pitch writing**, **major scales**, and/or **minor scales.** 

Also, please submit the next stage in your counterpoint work with your partner as follows:

- **If you passed both major and minor cantus firmi,** compose and perform two well-formed first-species exercises with your partner. Choose one major cantus firmus and one minor cantus firmus—choose from the models provided in class (and linked on the [cantus firmus resource](http://openmusictheory.com/cantusFirmus.html) or use the ones you composed this past week. (In most cases, using the models will be easier, since they have been used extensively in contrapuntal studies.) Compose a counterpoint *above* one of the cantus firmi, and another *below* the other cantus firmus. (For example, compose one above a major CF and one below a minor CF; or compose one above a minor CF and one below a major CF.) Submit your scores and performances the same way you submitted your cantus firmus assignment. (See instructions below.)  
- **If you did not pass your cantus firmus assignment,** correct your cantus firmi according to the feedback you received and re-submit the new score(s) and performance video(s) the same way you submitted them the first time.  
- **If you passed one cantus firmus and only require minor changes to the other,** submit the corrected cantus firmus and feel free to go ahead and attempt the first-species assignment, as well.

N.B.: if you are at all confused about the first-species assignment, please attempt at least one exercise (minor or major) and submit it. If it's good, you can do the other for Thursday. If not, you will get feedback and can schedule a meeting with Ashley or me, if necessary.

## October 2 prep

We will begin class with a single quiz: your choice between either **rhythmic notation writing** or **pitch writing**. Please review the relevant resource(s) on OMT.

The bulk of class will be devoted to work on issues related to first-species counterpoint composition. To prepare, please do the following:

- Review the [class notes from our collaborative *first-species* analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uPRS-B1e03pdwIG9Cvxq__KdveDK-oxyRBLY3bp1e1U/edit?usp=sharing).  
- Read the [Composing a first-species counterpoint](http://openmusictheory.com/firstSpecies.html) resource on OMT. Note the differences between these two resources to enter in the form below.  
- Read the (very short) resource on [Types of contrapuntal motion](http://openmusictheory.com/motionTypes.html).  
- Attempt the practice exercises at the end of the first-species resource.
- For each practice exercise, click on the arrow button ("Share this trinket with my friends"), copy the link, and paste it in the form below.  
- Finally, fill out the form below.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zrXfR-32mwDiSG1-XqVOadmGoqaY0g0Y0yAR_Kz1sRI/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>

Lastly, be sure to bring staff paper, a pencil, and a web-enabled device (phone is fine) to class on Thursday.

## September 30 prep

We will begin class with two quizzes. Choose two of the following three concepts, and prepare to pass those quizzes: **meter ID**, **time signature writing**, and/or **pitch ID**.

Please read the [Unit II Guide](mt1-unit2.html) on the course website. Bring any questions you have to class.

Review the [Composing a cantus firmus](http://openmusictheory.com/cantusFirmus.html) resource.

Find a partner, and together compose two *cantus firmi* that follow the principles laid out in the resource—one in major and one in minor. Notate them on the staff (with alto clef). Then make a video of you and your partner singing each *cantus firmus* in unison.

Take a picture of the notated *cantus firmi* and name the file "LASTNAME1 LASTNAME2 cantus firmi". Name the video(s) "LASTNAME1 LASTNAME2 cantus firmi performance".

Upload both files to your Google Drive account, and share both files with kris.shaffer@colorado.edu *and* ashley.appel@colorado.edu, granting us permission to edit the files. See [this short video](https://vimeo.com/73001492) for uploading/sharing instructions of you are new to Google Drive. Make sure you share it from your CU Google Apps account.

## September 25 prep

We will begin class with a single quiz: your choice between either **major scales** or **minor scales**. Please review the [Scales and scale degrees](http://openmusictheory.com/scales.html) resource on OMT. And keep in mind that since we are quizzing less topics per day now, it is absolutely important that you come prepared to pass each one. It will be some time before this quiz will be offered again.

The bulk of class will be devoted to work on cantus firmus composition. To prepare, please do the following:

- Review the [class notes from our collaborative *cantus firmus* analysis](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/184qg4LBiNK_R_mw61a813upINOe2hBsr13yIZRyh6zE/edit?usp=sharing).

- Attempt the practice exercise at the end of the cantus firmus resource. Before doing so, [watch the instruction video](http://vimeo.com/106846278). (Hang on to your solution, so you can submit it in the form.)  
- Finally, fill out the form below.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/forms/d/1UND4FHCiZ1nQtf1xmu0qbCTK28b5oKcCc742af05muk/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>

Lastly, be sure to bring staff paper, a pencil, and a web-enabled device (phone is fine) to class on Thursday.

## September 23 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on **pitch ID**. Please review the [Pitches and octave designations](http://openmusictheory.com/pitches.html) resource on OMT. And keep in mind that since we are quizzing less topics per day now, it is absolutely important that you come prepared to pass each one. It will be some time before this quiz will be offered again.

We will spend the bulk of class time beginning of our exploration of strict voice-leading, beginning with basic properties of well formed melodies. Please read the [Introduction to strict voice-leading](http://openmusictheory.com/speciesIntro.html) resource on OMT. Based on that reading, answer the following questions on the form below before the beginning of class. (These questions will help ensure that you have engaged *some* of the important concepts in the reading, and they will help me know what you did or did not understand before class, so we can clarify things as necessary.)

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pyGjUeErOhp12cORqLWK-gQQAuu_aPQiGeG-ChFz5WM/viewform?embedded=true" width="600" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>

- **meter ID**  
- **time signature writing**  
- **rhythmic notation**

After the quizzes, we will explore the topics of scale degrees and melodic transposition (two concepts to be added to the quiz rotation next week). To prepare, please read the following resource from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com):

- [Scales and scale degrees](http://openmusictheory.com/scales.html)

Most of this will be review, especially after the work you've done in Aural Skills so far, but come with the information fresh in your mind (and, if possible, loaded on your phone/tablet/laptop).

## September 16 prep

We will begin class with *four* quizzes: one 1-minute quiz, one 1.5-minute quiz, and two 3-minute quizzes. Choose which of the following you will prepare to pass.

Choose *one* of the following 1-minute quizzes:

- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch ID** – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

Choose *one* of the following 1.5-minute quizzes:

- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.

- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  
- **major scales** – write major scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **minor scales** – write minor scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch writing** – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

These quizzes will be *paper-based*. Please bring a pencil (or two, just in case).

After the quizzes, we will revisit protonotation and rhythmic notation. Please finish the first page (staff notation to protonotation) of the worksheet we began on the 9th and bring it to class. Also, please review the following resources from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com):

- [Rhythmic values](http://openmusictheory.com/rhythmicValues.html)  
- [Protonotation](http://openmusictheory.com/protonotation.html)

It is absolutely essential that you read these resources and come ready to apply them, and with specific questions about things that you don't understand.

Additionally, (re-)read any resources on OMT that may be helpful in your quiz preparation, and/or visit [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com) for practice exercises.

## September 9 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **meter** – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).  
- **time signatures** – write the appropriate time signature given a specified meter.  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.

- **clefs** – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch ID** – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch writing** – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.
