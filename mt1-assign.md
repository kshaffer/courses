Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## September 4 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **meter** – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).  
- **time signatures** – write the appropriate time signature given a specified meter.  
- **clefs** – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  

Prepare for these quizzes by reviewing materials on [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com), performing practice exercises on [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com), and/or drilling/discussing with a classmate.

Please bring a pencil (or two) and a web-enabled device to class.

## September 2 prep

There will be no quizzes on Tuesday, September 2 (see Sep 4 prep for Thursday's quizzes). Instead, we will discuss the [Open Letter](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/open-letter-students/) I shared with you last week, and solidify understanding of meter.

*Please be sure to bring a web-enabled device to class.*
