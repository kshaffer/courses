## October 2 prep

We will begin class with a single quiz: your choice between either **rhythmic notation writing** or **pitch writing**. Please review the relevant resource(s) on OMT.

The bulk of class will be devoted to work on issues related to first-species counterpoint composition. To prepare, please do the following:

- Review the [class notes from our collaborative *first-species* analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uPRS-B1e03pdwIG9Cvxq__KdveDK-oxyRBLY3bp1e1U/edit?usp=sharing).  
- Read the [Composing a first-species counterpoint](http://openmusictheory.com/firstSpecies.html) resource on OMT. Note the differences between these two resources to enter in the form below.  
- Read the (very short) resource on [Types of contrapuntal motion](http://openmusictheory.com/motionTypes.html).  
- Attempt the practice exercises at the end of the first-species resource.
- For each practice exercise, click on the arrow button ("Share this trinket with my friends"), copy the link, and paste it in the form below.  
- Finally, fill out the form below.

Lastly, be sure to bring staff paper, a pencil, and a web-enabled device (phone is fine) to class on Thursday.

## September 30 prep

We will begin class with two quizzes. Choose two of the following three concepts, and prepare to pass those quizzes: **meter ID**, **time signature writing**, and/or **pitch ID**.

Please read the [Unit II Guide](mt1-unit2.html) on the course website. Bring any questions you have to class.

Review the [Composing a cantus firmus](http://openmusictheory.com/cantusFirmus.html) resource.

Find a partner, and together compose two *cantus firmi* that follow the principles laid out in the resource—one in major and one in minor. Notate them on the staff (with alto clef). Then make a video of you and your partner singing each *cantus firmus* in unison.

Take a picture of the notated *cantus firmi* and name the file "LASTNAME1 LASTNAME2 cantus firmi". Name the video(s) "LASTNAME1 LASTNAME2 cantus firmi performance".

Upload both files to your Google Drive account, and share both files with kris.shaffer@colorado.edu *and* ashley.appel@colorado.edu, granting us permission to edit the files. See [this short video](https://vimeo.com/73001492) for uploading/sharing instructions of you are new to Google Drive. Make sure you share it from your CU Google Apps account.

## September 25 prep

We will begin class with a single quiz: your choice between either **major scales** or **minor scales**. Please review the [Scales and scale degrees](http://openmusictheory.com/scales.html) resource on OMT. And keep in mind that since we are quizzing less topics per day now, it is absolutely important that you come prepared to pass each one. It will be some time before this quiz will be offered again.

The bulk of class will be devoted to work on cantus firmus composition. To prepare, please do the following:

- Review the [class notes from our collaborative *cantus firmus* analysis](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/184qg4LBiNK_R_mw61a813upINOe2hBsr13yIZRyh6zE/edit?usp=sharing).  
- Read the [Composing a cantus firmus](http://openmusictheory.com/cantusFirmus.html) resource on OMT. Note the differences between these two resources to enter in the form below.  
- [Watch the video](http://vimeo.com/106846278) on using the Trinket modules embedded in OMT.  
- Attempt the practice exercise at the end of the cantus firmus resource. Before doing so, [watch the instruction video](http://vimeo.com/106846278). (Hang on to your solution, so you can submit it in the form.)  
- Finally, fill out the form below.

Lastly, be sure to bring staff paper, a pencil, and a web-enabled device (phone is fine) to class on Thursday.

## September 23 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on **pitch ID**. Please review the [Pitches and octave designations](http://openmusictheory.com/pitches.html) resource on OMT. And keep in mind that since we are quizzing less topics per day now, it is absolutely important that you come prepared to pass each one. It will be some time before this quiz will be offered again.

We will spend the bulk of class time beginning of our exploration of strict voice-leading, beginning with basic properties of well formed melodies. Please read the [Introduction to strict voice-leading](http://openmusictheory.com/speciesIntro.html) resource on OMT. Based on that reading, answer the following questions on the form below before the beginning of class. (These questions will help ensure that you have engaged *some* of the important concepts in the reading, and they will help me know what you did or did not understand before class, so we can clarify things as necessary.)

## September 18 prep

We will begin class with three quizzes on the following topics (see [Unit I Guide](http://courses.shaffermusic.com/mt1-unit1.html) for topic details):

- **meter ID**  
- **time signature writing**  
- **rhythmic notation**

After the quizzes, we will explore the topics of scale degrees and melodic transposition (two concepts to be added to the quiz rotation next week). To prepare, please read the following resource from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com):

- [Scales and scale degrees](http://openmusictheory.com/scales.html)

Most of this will be review, especially after the work you've done in Aural Skills so far, but come with the information fresh in your mind (and, if possible, loaded on your phone/tablet/laptop).

## September 16 prep

We will begin class with *four* quizzes: one 1-minute quiz, one 1.5-minute quiz, and two 3-minute quizzes. Choose which of the following you will prepare to pass.

Choose *one* of the following 1-minute quizzes:

- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch ID** – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

Choose *one* of the following 1.5-minute quizzes:

- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  

Choose *two* of the following 3-minute quizzes:

- **pitch writing** – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **major scales** – write major scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **minor scales** – write minor scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

Since Socrative does not support multiple quizzes simultaneously in the same online "classroom" (that I know of), all of these quizzes will be paper-based.

We will spend the remainder of class focusing on rhythmic notation. To prepare, *attempt to translate the protonotation rhythms in [the worksheet from class](materials/protoToRhythm.pdf) to staff notation, according to the instructions provided.*

It may be helpful to review the following resources from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com):

- [Rhythmic values](http://openmusictheory.com/rhythmicValues.html)  
- [Protonotation](http://openmusictheory.com/protonotation.html)


## September 11 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **clefs** – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  
- **key signature writing** – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **chromatic scale** – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  
- **major scales** – write major scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **minor scales** – write minor scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch writing** – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

These quizzes will be *paper-based*. Please bring a pencil (or two, just in case).

After the quizzes, we will revisit protonotation and rhythmic notation. Please finish the first page (staff notation to protonotation) of the worksheet we began on the 9th and bring it to class. Also, please review the following resources from [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com):

- [Rhythmic values](http://openmusictheory.com/rhythmicValues.html)  
- [Protonotation](http://openmusictheory.com/protonotation.html)

It is absolutely essential that you read these resources and come ready to apply them, and with specific questions about things that you don't understand.

Additionally, (re-)read any resources on OMT that may be helpful in your quiz preparation, and/or visit [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com) for practice exercises.

## September 9 prep

We will begin class with a quiz on the following six concepts:

- **meter** – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).  
- **time signatures** – write the appropriate time signature given a specified meter.  
- **key signature ID** – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  
- **pitch ID** – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  

These quizzes will be *electronic* (using [Socrative](http://socrative.com)). Please bring a web-friendly device. If you cannot, or if you would prefer paper, contact me by noon on Monday, and I will print you a paper quiz.

After the quizzes, we will follow up on our recent study of meter by exploring its implications for rhythmic notation. To prepare, please read the following two resources from Open Music Theory:

- [Rhythmic values](http://openmusictheory.com/rhythmicValues.html)  
- [Protonotation](http://openmusictheory.com/protonotation.html)

Additionally, (re-)read any resources on OMT that may be helpful in your quiz preparation, and/or visit [Teoria.com](http://teoria.com) for practice exercises.
