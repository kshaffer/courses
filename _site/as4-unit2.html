<h1>Unit II: Introduction to post-tonal music</h1>

<p>Unit II will comprise an introduction to the performance and aural recognition of some common post-tonal pitch materials and asymmetrical meters and rhythms.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>The following materials will be assigned or may supplement assigned materials in order to help you meet the goals outlined under <em>Concepts and assessment</em>, most of which can be found on Kris Shaffer&#39;s <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship">Musicianship Resources</a> website (which also contains helpful review materials). This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.</p>

<h2>Concepts and assessment</h2>

<p>The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/B/A/P grading scale outlined on the <a href="/auralskills4.html">syllabus</a>) are divided into two categories: <em>post-tonal pitch materials</em> and <em>advanced rhythm and meter</em>. They are listed below, followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as &quot;I can . . .&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Post-tonal pitch materials (Unit II)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>recognize common modes and cells in isolation by ear (diatonic, pentatonic, octatonic, whole-tone, etc.)<br></li>
<li>recognize common modes and cells in a musical passage by ear<br></li>
<li>transcribe music making use of common modes and cells (no instrument or time constraints)<br></li>
<li>perform common modes and cells in isolation (sung)<br></li>
<li>perform from sight music that makes use of common modes and cells (instrument of choice)<br></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advanced rhythm and meter (Unit II)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>recognize common asymmetrical meters in a passage by ear (quintuple, septuple, changing, &quot;asymmetrical compound&quot;)<br></li>
<li>transcribe the rhythm of a melody/passage in a common asymmetrical meter<br></li>
<li>perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters from sight (sung or instrumental)<br></li>
<li>perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters in a real piece of music from sight (instrument of choice)</li>
</ul>

<p>In-class or take-home/online assessment activities will be given for all of these concepts and skills. These assignments and quizzes will provide sufficient opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery by the unit deadline. Additional attempts then become the responsibility of the student to be submitted or performed during office hours.</p>
