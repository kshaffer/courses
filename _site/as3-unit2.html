<h1 id="unit-ii-classical-era-transcription-and-improvisation">Unit II: Classical-era transcription and improvisation</h1>

<p>Musicians are not simply people who can play notes, rhythms, and chords correctly. Musicians know what they are hearing when they hear it, and they know when expectations are being played with. Musicians can verbally describe what they hear, can mimic it, notate it, riff on it. Musicians can play all the notes, rhythms, and chords correctly, while still paying attention to what they hear, what is coming next, what is going wrong, and adjust their performance accordingly. This is the kind of musicianship we are going for in this class.</p>

<p>In Unit I, we did some “<a href="http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents2/essays/alegant.html">scuba diving</a>” in pop/rock music, taking our time as we explored a few things very deeply. In this unit, we will speed things up: exploring smaller snippets of music, and trying to come to the same deep understanding of them, but much more quickly. Doing so will help us speed up our ability to identify and analyze what we hear, so that we can make use of that understanding in real time. </p>

<p>In Unit I (and last year), we studied the performance of composed music. In this unit, we will take our performance to the next level, exploring the art of improvisation in a musical style. The goal is not to become musicians who can improvise an entire classical piece in a concert setting—though classical-style improvisation skills can come in handy in more musical situations than you might think. The goal is to become musicians who can pay full attention to the notes on the page, the music being played around you, and the fundamental structures underlying that music, and then using all of that information to guide decisions about the performance— all the while maintaining composure (and quality) while performing.</p>

<p>In both transcription and performance, we will be returning to the classical style, tying some of the skills we developed in Unit I to some of the musical structures you studied in Music Theory II. (This will, in turn, support the work we will do in Music Theory III this semester.)</p>

<p>Details for this unit are provided below.</p>

<h2 id="concepts-and-assessment">Concepts and assessment</h2>

<p>The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the <a href="/auralskills3.html">syllabus</a>) are divided into two categories: <em>classical transcription</em> and <em>classical improvisation</em>. They are listed below, followed by assessment criteria. Read all concept/skill objectives as “I can . . .”</p>

<p><strong>Classical transcription (Unit II)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Transcribe the melody of a classical-style instrumental theme.  </li>
  <li>Transcribe the harmonic progression of a classical-style instrumental theme.  </li>
  <li>Recognize by ear the formal structure (period, sentence, hybrid, compound theme, or a single phrase) of a classical-style instrumental theme.  </li>
  <li>Recognize by ear the <em>galant</em> schemata of a classical-style instrumental theme.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Assessment tasks will include multiple short classical themes or phrases, or one longer theme. Each assessment will receive four marks of N/A/P, corresponding to these four objectives. Perfect or near-perfect accuracy is required for a mark of P. Assessments will take place in-class and will involve either a short number of hearings (via a recording or a piano performance) or a short amount of time in which to transcribe a passage while listening via Spotify (or the like). Half-credit will be given for objectives that are completed outside of class and/or with the assistance of an instrument or software.</p>

<p>Overall grades for each assessment will be assigned as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: 4 objectives met  </li>
  <li>B+: 3.5 objectives met  </li>
  <li>B: 3 objectives met  </li>
  <li>C+: 2.5 objectives met  </li>
  <li>C: 2 objectives met  </li>
  <li>D+: 1.5 objective met  </li>
  <li>D: 1 objective met  </li>
  <li>F: 0 or 0.5 objectives met</li>
</ul>

<p>The end-of-unit grade for this category will be the average of the highest two of the last three assessments performed. There will be no live (full credit) reassessments for this category during finals week, only take-home (half-credit) reassessments.</p>

<p><strong>Classical improvisation (Unit II)</strong></p>

<p>Students will be assessed for their ability to perform an improvised melody in the form of a <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/sentence.html">sentence</a> on any instrument (or voice) they choose that is idiomatic to the classical instrumental style. Students will be given a harmonic progression (typically 1–2 chords per bar) and <em>galant</em> schemata to reflect in the melody.</p>

<p>In improvisation assessments, students will be allowed to choose both the instrument and the level of difficulty for the melody they improvise. The highest level of difficulty successfully performed during the unit will determine the unit grade for this objective. Students will be allowed at least two assessment attempts (and one reassessment during finals week). Additional attempts are at the discretion of the instructor/TA.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improvise a classical-style melody with 1–2 chord tones per chord/stage (D level)  </li>
  <li>Improvise a classical-style melody with 3 or more chord tones per chord/stage (C level)  </li>
  <li>Improvise a classical-style melody with multiple properly treated diatonic non-chord tones (B level)  </li>
  <li>Improvise a classical-style melody with multiple properly treated chromatic non-chord tones (A level)</li>
</ul>
