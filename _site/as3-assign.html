<h2 id="december-3-assignment">December 3 assignment</h2>

<p>Please complete the transcription begun in class (audio and timings are provided on the <a href="as3-unit2.html">Unit II Guide</a>): Mendelssohn, Op. 13, iii. or Haydn, Hob. XVI:35, iii. Follow the instructions for the Nomvember 19 assignment.</p>

<h2 id="december-1-prep">December 1 prep</h2>

<p>None. Please bring staff paper, a pencil, and (Shaffer section) headphones.</p>

<h2 id="november-19-assignment">November 19 assignment</h2>

<p>Please complete the transcription begun in class (audio and timings are provided on the <a href="as3-unit2.html">Unit II Guide</a>). Elements completed accurately in class will receive full credit, elements completed accurately as homework will receive half credit. You may use an instrument if you like—whatever will help you figure out good strategies for fast transcription in the future. Be sure <em>not</em> to consult a score, until after you have submitted your transcription.</p>

<p>Transcribe the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Melody (first violin part)  </li>
  <li>Harmony (Roman numerals and figured bass)  </li>
  <li>Schemas (any that you hear from our list of common schema; if you hear none, write that on the score, or you will not get credit.)  </li>
  <li>Form (simply label it sentence, period, hybrid, or compound)</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit, please write on the score “I reaffirm the CU honor code,” indicating that you have not consulted a score or other people in your transcription attempts. Then submit to your instructor by uploading it to Google Drive and sharing it with him. You may put it in notation software, export a PDF, and share that file. Or you may simply take a picture of your paper and upload that picture. Please do not upload Finale/Sibelius/etc. files unless your instructor asks for them in class, as we don’t all have the same software and versions. Use PDFs instead.</p>

<p>Also, if you did not achieve the grade you desire in the first attempt of improvisation recitations, sign up for a time on Wednesday/Thursday for a second (and final) attempt. Shaffer students can <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY">sign up here</a>. (Check your timezone first!)</p>

<h2 id="november-17-assignment">November 17 assignment</h2>

<p>On the <a href="as3-unit2.html">Unit II Guide</a>, find the audio for Haydn’s string quartet, Hob. III:66, third movement. For the first 11 seconds (mm. 1–8), transcribe the four elements listed under the <strong>Classical transcription (Unit II)</strong> assessment information: the melody (Violin I part), the harmony (Roman numerals and figured bass), the formal structure (just label sentence/period/hybrid/compound), and label any <em>galant</em> schemata you hear.</p>

<p>This is the first of several transcription assessments. Keep in mind (per the unit guide) that take-home transcriptions are half-credit for grades, but it will be both a good opportunity to get the transcription right on the first attempt, as well as practice for developing strategies that will work “live” when we do fast transcriptions in class.</p>

<p>Unless your instructor informs you otherwise, you are welcome to submit via paper in class, or electronically before the start of class.</p>

<h2 id="november-12-prep">November 12 prep</h2>

<p>There is no homework. See you in class!</p>

<h2 id="november-46-improv-assessments">November 4–6 improv assessments</h2>

<p>This will be the first of two regular attempts at assessing classical theme improvisation. Details can be found <a href="as3-improvAssess.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>SHAFFER SECTION ONLY: Time slots are now available for improvisation assessments on <strong>November 4, 9:30–10:00am and 2:00–2:30pm.</strong> You can sign up <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY">here.</a> If none of these times work for you, please let me know ASAP, since I am leaving first thing Wednesday morning for my conference.</p>

<p>ARNETT &amp; SIMMONS SECTIONS: Sign up in accordance with the instructions provided by your instructor.</p>

<h2 id="november-3-assignment">November 3 assignment</h2>

<p>Record yourself (audio or video, whichever is most convenient) improvising a sentence melody on your primary instrument (with solfège, if voice) that follows one of the following schema sequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meyer – 5-phase Prinner  </li>
  <li>Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound HC  </li>
  <li>Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound PAC  </li>
  <li>Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Fa–fi–sol HC  </li>
  <li>Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Simple PAC</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that these are the five example sentences provided at the end of the OMT resource on <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html">Improvising a sentence with galnt schemata</a>. Look to those examples for guidance. Your melodies can be in any key and in any standard meter (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).</p>

<p>Since you are submitting a recording, you are free to prepare your improvisation by practicing different possibilities. To do so, you can play along with the audio excerpts added to the <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html">Improvising a sentence</a> resource, all of which are in C major and simple quadruple time. (Thanks to Mark Arnett for making these!) You may also record multiple takes and submit the best one. (Since preparing and making multiple attempts at an improvisation looks a like composition, we’re dubbing this a “comprovisation.”)</p>

<p>As you practice, you may want to work your way up the <a href="http://courses.shaffermusic.com/as3-unit2.html">assessment rubric</a>, beginning with D-level or C-level melodies, and then adding embellishments to reach B-level and A-level complexity that makes good musical sense. Aim for A-level, but submit the highest level that you are able to accomplish with musicality.</p>

<p>Submit your “comprovisation” before class according to the same procedures that you submitted your pop/rock performance on Google Drive.</p>

<h2 id="october-29-assignment">October 29 assignment</h2>

<p>In order to assist you in matching the “galant”/”classical” style in your improvisations, please listen to the opening themes of the following movements. Spotify recordings are embedded below. You can find scores on <a href="http://imslp.org">IMSLP.org</a> or in the library. </p>

<p>Try listening without a score first, and see if you can hear the hallmark elements of the schemas listed. Then load up the score and listen again, noting which elements of the schema(s) are and aren’t present, as well as how they are embellished. If you can’t find evidence of a particular schema, take note, and we can discuss it in class.</p>

<p>Haydn, Piano Sonata in C Major, Hob. XVI:21, I., mm. 1–4. <em>sol–fa–mi</em>.  </p>

<h2 id="october-27-exam-and-assignment">October 27 exam and assignment</h2>

<p>Complete the <a href="as3-popRockPerf.html">pop/rock performance project</a> and submit before the normal class time on Monday.</p>

<p>Sign up for a sight-reading exam. You can practice by sight-reading passages in the collection approved transcriptions. (More will be added as they are assessed.) Though keep in mind that the sight-reading exam will include simpler melodies than these. You can sight-read on voice (with solfège) or on your primary instrument (if not voice).</p>

<p>Shaffer students, please sign up on Google Calendar by <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY">following this link</a>. Please double-check your time zone first! (All exam times are between 7:50am and 8:50am on Monday morning.)</p>

<h2 id="october-22-prep">October 22 prep</h2>

<p>Please take a look at the additional materials on <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html">Improvizing a sentence with galant schemata</a> and review the cadence schemata that were added to the <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/schemataSummary.html">schema summary page</a>. We will spend some time working further on improvising complete themes using these schemata.</p>

<h2 id="october-20-prep">October 20 prep</h2>

<p>For Monday, please put together and submit your <a href="as3-popRockPerf.html">pop/rock performance project</a>. (Shaffer section has an extension on this—we’ll discuss in class on Monday.)</p>

<p>Also, please read the OMT page on <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html">Improvizing a sentence with galant schemata</a> and watch the (9 minute) video at the end. Please omit the material and exercises that follow the video under “Putting it together.” That will be for Wednesday.</p>

<h2 id="october-15-prep">October 15 prep</h2>

<p>Read the <a href="as3-unit2.html">Unit II Guide</a>, and bring to class any questions you have about it. Optionally, bring your primary instrument to class.</p>

<h2 id="october-13-prep">October 13 prep</h2>

<p>All transcriptions must be completed, approved by at least two classmates, and submitted by the start of class in order to count toward the Unit II grade. You will have until Oct. 20 to complete performances.</p>

<h2 id="october-6-prep">October 6 prep</h2>

<p><em>Either</em> find three classmates to approve your performance-ready transcription <em>or</em> get your transcription into performance-ready shape by Monday. Let’s get all the transcriptions finished, solid, and in for assessment this week.</p>

<h2 id="october-1-prep">October 1 prep</h2>

<p>If you are confident in the status of your transcription project, seek out classmates to provide official approval, per <a href="as3-trans.html">the project guidelines</a>. Otherwise, seek feedback (from me or your peers) or wait for feedback from me before proceeding.</p>

<p>Also, start thinking about options for the <a href="as3-popRockPerf.html">performance project</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, if practical, please bring your primary instrument to class on Wednesday.</p>

<h2 id="september-29-prep">September 29 prep</h2>

<p>Based on the comments you have received thus far (comments from me are coming soon if you haven’t already received them), finish a complete draft of your transcription for Monday. Please send to me electronically (email or GDrive) before class.</p>

<h2 id="september-24-prep">September 24 prep</h2>

<p>Fix your transcription based on the comments you received from you colleague. <em>Do not</em> simply make changes they suggest, but examine their comments carefully to see if they are helpful/correct or not. (You will receive many comments for musical improvement in your career, and not all of them will be helpful.) If you are in good shape, you can also begin to work on the remainder of the song. Complete drafts will be due on Sept. 29.</p>

<h2 id="september-22-peer-review-assignment">September 22 peer-review assignment</h2>

<p>Send an electronic copy of your transcription (PDF required; notation program file optional) as well as a link to your recording online to the partner you worked with in class on the 17th. Also, send me a copy of your transcription as it currently stands (email is fine, or share on Google Drive).</p>

<p>Then provide detailed, strategic feedback on your partner’s transcription in an email to them that is copied to me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu), before Monday’s class.</p>

<p>Finally, come to class ready to sing (some of) your colleagues’ transcriptions with a critical eye/ear.</p>

<h2 id="september-17-prep">September 17 prep</h2>

<p>Fix any issues noted by your classmate(s) on 9/15. Take note of both specific notes/chords/passages <em>and</em> any general trends noted that may come up elsewhere.</p>

<p>Then complete your <a href="as3-trans.html">transcription</a> of the remainder of the musical texture for your first cycle (i.e., all vocals, instrumental lines, bass, chords). </p>

<p>If your transcription is not already in notation software, typeset it in Finale, Sibelius, MuseScore, NoteFlight, Lilypond, etc., and bring it to class. (You can bring your own computer, or you can upload it to your Google Drive account and open it on the lab computer, assuming software and versions are the same. – I know MuseScore is up-to-date, and NoteFlight is web-based, so that will work with little/no difficulty, as well.)</p>

<h2 id="september-15-prep">September 15 prep</h2>

<p>Transcribe two of the following elements of the first cycle (through the end of the first chorus or first AABA unit) of your transcription project song: melody, bass, chords (lead-sheet and RNs). Bring the transcription to class. If the song is not on Spotify, bring audio to share with a classmate as you critique each other’s transcriptions. Notation software is not required, but you may want to begin entering it into Finale, Sibelius, MuseScore, NoteFlight, or Lilypond, since your transcription should be in notation software for the 17th. If you have never used notation software before, I highly recommend <a href="http://musescore.org">MuseScore</a>.</p>

<h2 id="september-10-prep">September 10 prep</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Transcribe the melody of the first cycle of St. Vincent, “Digital Witness”: 0:00–1:05 (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/5L16tlSHNt93RiiRiCc8ya">Spotify web</a>, <a href="spotify:track:5L16tlSHNt93RiiRiCc8ya">Spotify app</a>). Be sure to include key signature, and be precise as possible with the rhythm and pitch of the melody. Though not required, both using notation software and transcribing the lyrics may help you in the transcription process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose a song for big transcription project. Either select a song from the list provided, or suggest a song of your own choosing for instructor approval. The project will involve the transcription of melody, bass, chords, and any vocal or instrumental parts that constitute something other than block chords, so take all of those parameters into account when choosing a song. Transcription project details can be found <a href="as3-trans.html">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="september-8-prep">September 8 prep</h2>

<p>Listen to “I Am the Walrus” following along with the model transcription distributed in class (not posted on the open web because of copyright concerns). Play special attention to areas that gave you trouble, and use a keyboard or another instrument to guide you in singing and/or playing the chord progressions in the song.</p>

<p>Read/watch the <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/syncopation.html">Open Music Theory resource</a> on transcribing syncopated rhythms in pop/rock music before Monday’s class. Come with any questions you have.</p>

<h2 id="september-3-prep">September 3 prep</h2>

<p>Read about Rock’s “tonal systems” at <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/popRockHarmony.html">Open Music Theory</a> (bottom of the page; follow all four links).</p>

<p>Find a recording of “I Am the Walrus” by The Beatles, and transcribe the bass line for 0:21–1:03. Then provide a Roman numeral analysis underneath the bass line based on what you hear. Be careful with chord qualities, as not all of them match the standard qualities for major/minor tonality. Lastly, write down any schemas or “tonal systems” that you think are influencing part or all of the passage. Bring your transcription to class.</p>

<h2 id="august-27-prep">August 27 prep</h2>

<p>Read the following and come to class with any questions you have.</p>

<ul>
