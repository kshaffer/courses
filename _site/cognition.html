<h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>

<p>Music is an art. Music is a language. Music is therapy. Music is <a href="http://www.musictherapy.org">a clinical tool</a>. Music is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations">weapon</a>. Music is an area of humanistic inquiry. Music is math. Music is neuroscience. Music is communal. Music is deeply personal. Music is <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/13/entertainment/ca-musichurts13">bug spray</a>. Music is religion. Music is <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3505052W/Music_in_Everyday_Life">identity formation</a>. Music is culture. Music is psychology.</p>

<p>Music is nearly unparalleled in its ability to engage just about every facet of our lives. Perhaps only language has the same reach into our biology, psychology, individual identity, and social community. Music both frames, and is dependent on, our memory. Music both affects and flows from our emotions. Music both embodies and transcends cultural prejudice. And despite its heavily scientific base, even professional musicians treat it with an air of mystery.</p>

<p>Music cognition explores all of these things. In a sense, music cognition is the study of music. And that is why to be a “cognitive musicologist” is as vague as to be a “musician.” Some cognitive musicologists study the scientific basis of music theory; some explore the anthropological side of music in community; others are psychologists, neurologists, or psycholinguists with an interest in music; still others are therapists, studying music for its clinical value and employing it in the treatment of Alzheimers, autism, amnesia, or stroke-enduced aphasia.</p>

<p>A course in music cognition could easily become a class in neurology, psychology, linguistics, computational analysis, medicine… And that often follows the direction of the interests of the particular professor leading the course. </p>

<p>But this course is yours. </p>

<p>We will begin the course with several weeks exploring the basic concepts underlying the biology and psychology of musical structures and practices. There will be readings and discussions (and even a few quizzes) relating to these concepts that form the core of just about any cognitive exploration of music. The remainder of the course, however, will be shaped by you—group activities and individual projects that you choose to help you engage and apply these and other music-cognitive concepts in the contexts of your specific disciplines and goals.</p>

<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>

<p>We will meet every Friday during the semester, with the exception of Nov. 7 (SMT/AMS), and Fall/Thanksgiving Break. On Nov. 21 (the day before Fall Break), we will be joined by Ian Quinn, professor of music theory and cognitive science at Yale University.</p>

<p>In Weeks 1–7, we will explore some of the “nuts and bolts” of music cognition. These topics and readings will be determined by me, and will come largely (but not exclusively) from Patrick Colm Hogan’s <em>Cognitive Science, Literature, and the Arts: A Guide for Humanists</em> and Bob Snyder’s <em>Music and Memory: An Introduction</em>.</p>

<p>In Weeks 8–15, we will explore more advanced and discipline-specific topics, based on discussions and negotiations we have as a class during weeks 5–7. Some of these discussions will be student-led, and some will be based around summative student projects.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that the entire class community can participate in a high-level, nuanced discussion of the readings, each class will begin with a quiz on the basic facts of each text. You will know the questions in advance, and will simply memorize answers. Having this information in your mind at the beginning of class will help us go into much more detail and nuance, with the foundation of the entire class (at least temporarily) having the relevant facts ready for mental recall. Class time will <em>not</em> simply regurgitate facts, but use those facts as the basis of deeper discussion.</p>

<p>Assigned readings and quiz information (see below about quizzes) can be found on the <a href="cognition-schedule.html">schedule page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<p>The most important and interesting aspects of learning—especially at the graduate level—are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/">undermine alternative perspectives</a>—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.</p>

<p>That said, I am required to assign final grades for this course. My goal in grading is two-fold: to diminish their significance and the negative impact they can have on the learning environment, and to make sure that they do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.</p>

<p>So grades will follow the following pattern: I expect no Ds and Fs, but those grades will be reserved for students who fail to internalize the “nuts and bolts” of cognitive musicology. Cs will be given to students who sufficiently internalize those basic concepts, but no more. As and Bs are reserved for students who make new contributions to human knowledge, through a nuanced critique of existing knowledge, and/or through the application of existing knowledge into a new domain (for example, developing teaching methods for your instrument based on knowledge of working memory limitations).</p>

<p>In order to ensure that all serious students in the class attain a basic working knowledge of the course material, I will set the standard for a C. To obtain a C in the class, students must pass a series of weekly quizzes that cover the raw informational content of the week’s readings. Passing a quiz means getting at least 9 out of 10 questions factually accurate. Passing the series of quizzes means passing <em>all but two quizzes</em> during the semester. Generally there will be no makeups or reassessments; the two-quiz allowance should suffice for most cases. In exigent circumstances, other arrangements can be made at my discretion.</p>

<p>How exactly students may demonstrate the nuance, critique, and application required for an A or B will be negotiated among the class about half-way through the semester. This will ensure every student has a chance to align the course goals (contributing to human knowledge) with their own musical goals in their end-of-semester work, and it will ensure that students gain experience setting their own goals and assessing their own progress towards them.</p>

<h3 id="final-project-as-decided-by-class-consensus-on-1031">Final project (as decided by class consensus on 10/31)</h3>

<p>The class will collaborate on a blog, in which each student writes about a topic of their choice. Topics will include applications of music cognition studies to each students own professional goals and/or interests. Each student will also offer comments to each other’s posts and help publicize them on Twitter (and other social media as desired). </p>

<p>To receive an A for the course, a student will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>write two blog posts at the appointed time.  </li>
  <li>lead discussion for 20–30 of class in response to each post.  </li>
  <li>comment on at least two posts by classmates, with new ideas or constructive criticism. (I.e., more than “this is interesting” or “good job” comments.)  </li>
  <li>vote on whether or not classmates’ posts meet the objectives (see above on contributing to new knowledge, demonstrating nuance, etc.).  </li>
  <li>revise any posts that did not meet the class’s standard by the following Wednesday to bring them up to standard.  </li>
  <li>write either a third blog post, or an expanded synthesis of the original two posts, at the end of the semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>If not all of these objectives are met, each <em>up-to-standard</em> write-up and each leading of class discussion will be worth one “point”; the blog comments together will make up one “point” and the up-to-standard final write-up will be worth two “points.” Each point will increase the final grade one +/–. Everyone is starting at a C, after the quizzes, so 1 point is C+, 2 points B–, . . . 6 points an A.</p>

<p>Write-ups are due at 10am on Wednesday for each week assigned. Between that time and Friday’s class, all of the class will read the posts, and those not scheduled to write will provide insightful, constructive comments. Then the authors will lead discussion in class on their post/topic.</p>

<p>Posts will be published on the <a href="http://shaffermusic.com/muscog/">class Wordpress blog</a>. Please submit write-ups by posting them there, or by posting them to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cTDlyeURLcHdxQ28&amp;usp=sharing">Google Drive folder</a>.</p>
