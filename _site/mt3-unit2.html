<h1 id="unit-ii-classical-themes-with-chromaticism-and-modulation">Unit II: Classical themes (with chromaticism and modulation)</h1>

<p>Unit I will cover classical form. We will review and build on the work you did on phrases, periods, and sentences in Semester 2 Theory; review and build on the concepts of formal functions, modules, and whole-song/movement structures from Unit I of this course; and introduce and go into depth on the normative structures of classical movements.</p>

<p>The overall goal for this unit is for all students to be able to identify the key structural elements of standard classical theme forms (phrases, sentences, periods, hybrid themes, and compound themes) and to gain a familiarity with chromatic chords common to the classical style, as well as tonal modulation.</p>

<p>The provisional end-of-unit deadline is Monday, November 3.</p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p>We will be following the theories of <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2689355W/Classical_form">William E. Caplin</a> for our study of classical theme forms, and the theories of <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4294182W/Elements_of_sonata_theory">James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy</a> for our study of sonata form (in Unit III). If you would like to study their theories in greater detail, or look up supplemental examples of what we engage in class, check out those book links. However, all required material for this unit will be posted here (mostly from <a href="http://openmusictheory.com">Open Music Theory</a>):</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p>Our coursework in this unit will be directed towards to goal of consistent, correct identification and interpretation of the following concepts or structural elements in the context of classical-era pieces. Read as “I can identify and interpret . . .”</p>

<p>Classical themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>modulation (labeling all key areas, and properly notating when keys change)  </li>
  <li>harmony (labeling chords with Roman numerals and figured bass; interpreting them with T/S/D labels—all diatonic, applied, and standard chromatic chords)  </li>
  <li>cadences (PAC, IAC, HC)  </li>
  <li>sub-phrases (basic ideas, contrasting ideas)  </li>
  <li>phrases (presentation, continuation, antecedent, consequent, compound basic idea)  </li>
  <li>themes (sentences, periods, hybrid themes, compound themes)  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>After we get some basic (re)familiarity with these concepts, there will be weekly assessments in which you will have an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the above concepts by identifying them in pieces of music not covered in class. These will be similar to the weekly assessments in Unit I. You will receive at least two assessment opportunities for each concept during the unit. Upon taking the quiz, you will receive one of the following marks for each concept: <strong>P – passing</strong>, <strong>A - attempted</strong>, or <strong>N – not attempted</strong>. </p>

<p>Your unit grade will take into account only your mark for the <em>most recent quiz</em> that covered a given concept. If you do not take a quiz, your marks from the previous quiz will be taken. (So, for example, if you pass all categories before the last quiz, you can skip that quiz. Likewise, if you miss the first quiz for a set of concepts, you can “make it up” by taking the next quiz.)</p>

<p>Unit letter grades will be determined by the number of concepts you have passed by the final quiz:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: 6 concepts passing  </li>
  <li>B: 5 concepts passing  </li>
  <li>C: 4 concepts passing  </li>
  <li>D: 2–3 concepts passing  </li>
  <li>F: 0–1 concepts passing</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be an end-of-unit reassessment opportunity, per the syllabus.</p>
