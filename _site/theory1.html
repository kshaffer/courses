<h3 id="musical-concepts-and-fluency">Musical concepts and fluency</h3>

<p>The goal of this course (and the entire music theory and aural skills sequences) is musical fluency: that is, the successful depositing of musical information into readily-accessible long-term memory, and the successful cognitive assimilation of musical concepts and structures. </p>

<p>This semester, we will focus on gaining fluency with fundamental concepts and elements of Western musical notation, an understanding of the basic cognitive concepts that underlie musical theory and practice, and significant experience applying those concepts in the composition and analysis of music. Compositional exercises will be focused this semester on <em>strict</em> musical styles, but we will relate the concepts explored in those strict styles to other, <em>freer</em> historical styles. (Future semesters in the sequence will explore composition and analysis more deeply in a variety of historical styles.) </p>

<p>The course will be divided into three units of study: <em>fundamentals &amp; cognition</em>, <em>strict composition in two voices</em>, and <em>strict composition in four voices</em>—roughly five weeks each.</p>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<p>Assessment will follow a <em>contract grading</em> model. Students will decide what letter grade they want to pursue, and then ensure that they successfully complete the work listed below for that grade. </p>

<p>All work will be graded pass/fail, and each specific objective need only be met once to be complete. There are no average grades. Instead, at any given point in the semester, students will have a current mark of <strong>N – not attempted</strong>, <strong>A – attempted</strong>, or <strong>P – passed</strong> for each objective.</p>

<p>Generally, students will be given multiple opportunities during each unit to demonstrate mastery of each concept, or a significant amount of time in which to work on (and seek feedback on) a major project. More details are provided in the unit guides, and below under <em>reassessment</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Unit I and II assessments are due at the end of Unit II (November 4). Unit III assessments are due at the end of Unit III.</strong></p>

<p>Following are the <em>fundamentals</em> concepts, due by the end of Unit II. Once passed, a student does not need to take a quiz on that concept again. Read all as “I can . . .”</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>meter</strong> – recognize the meter of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).  </li>
  <li><strong>time signatures</strong> – write the appropriate time signature given a specified meter.  </li>
  <li><strong>rhythmic notation</strong> – write the appropriate rhythmic notation (including beaming) for a passage of music, given a <em>protonotation</em> version of that passage.  </li>
  <li><strong>clefs</strong> – draw treble, alto, and bass clefs appropriately on the staff (30 seconds – one of each clef).  </li>
  <li><strong>key signature ID</strong> – identify major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  </li>
  <li><strong>key signature writing</strong> – write major and minor key signatures on treble, alto, and bass staves.  </li>
  <li><strong>pitch ID</strong> – identify pitches (both pitch-class and register) on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  </li>
  <li><strong>pitch writing</strong> – write pitches on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  </li>
  <li><strong>chromatic scale</strong> – write a chromatic scale, ascending with sharps/naturals, descending with flats/naturals.  </li>
  <li><strong>major scales</strong> – write major scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  </li>
  <li><strong>minor scales</strong> – write minor scales on the treble, alto, and bass staves.  </li>
  <li><strong>scale-degree ID</strong> – identify the scale-degree (1–7) of pitches in specific keys.  </li>
  <li><strong>transposition</strong> – transpose a melody from one key into another.  </li>
  <li><strong>interval ID</strong> – identify the diatonic interval of a dyad.  </li>
  <li><strong>interval writing</strong> – write a specified diatonic interval above or below a given pitch.  </li>
  <li><strong>triad ID</strong> – identify root and quality of major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads. (This will count as a Unit III objective.)  </li>
  <li><strong>triad writing</strong> – write major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads given root and quality. (This will count as a Unit III objective.)  </li>
  <li><strong>seventh ID</strong> – identify root and quality of major, minor, dominant, fully diminished, and half-diminished seventh chords. (This will count as a Unit III objective.)  </li>
  <li><strong>seventh writing</strong> – write major, minor, dominant, fully diminished, and half-diminished seventh chords given root and quality. (This will count as a Unit III objective.)  </li>
  <li><strong>Roman numerals</strong> – label a triad or seventh chord with the appropriate Roman numeral given a specified key. (This will count as a Unit III objective.)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Strict voice-leading in two parts</em> concepts (species counterpoint), due at the end of Unit II (note that major and minor versions each count as their own concept for final-grade purposes):  </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>cantus firmus</strong> – compose and perform (video) a well formed <em>cantus firmus</em> in a major key and another in a minor key, with a partner.  </li>
  <li><strong>first species</strong> – compose and perform (video) a well formed first-species counterpoint exercise in a major key and another in a minor key, with a partner. One exercise should have the counterpoint above the CF, the other below.  </li>
  <li><strong>second species</strong> – compose and perform (video) a well formed second-species counterpoint exercise in a major key and another in a minor key, with a partner. One exercise should have the counterpoint above the CF, the other below.  </li>
  <li><strong>fourth species</strong> – compose and perform (video) a well formed fourth-species counterpoint exercise in a major key and another in a minor key, with a partner. One exercise should have the counterpoint above the CF, the other below.  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Strict voice-leading in four parts</em> concepts (keyboard style), due at the end of Unit III (again, major and minor versions each count as their own concept for final-grade purposes):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>basso continuo</strong> – realize (notate and perform—video) a figured bass line in four-part, <em>basso continuo</em> keyboard style. No partner. One realization in major, one in minor.  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Theoretical thinking</em> objectives for the semester (each of the four count as a concept for final-grade purposes):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose four voice-leading principles (two from strict two-voice composition, two from strict four-voice composition). For each one, write no more than a paragraph, or create a video of no more than 1.5 minutes, explaining how that principle relates to one or more concepts of music perception and cognition, and compare/contrast that relationship to a pattern/rule/principle in a free musical style (classical keyboard, opera, choral, pop/rock, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>Final grades will be determined by the number of concepts successfully passed. There are 20 <em>fundamentals</em> concepts, 8 <em>species counterpoint</em> concepts, 4 <em>keyboard voice-leading</em> concepts, and 4 <em>theoretical thinking</em> objectives. The following numbers of concepts must be passed to receive the corresponding grades:</p>

<ul>
  <li>33 concepts passed: A+  </li>
  <li>31 concepts passed: A  </li>
  <li>30 concepts passed: A–  </li>
  <li>29 concepts passed: B+  </li>
  <li>27 concepts passed: B  </li>
  <li>26 concepts passed: B–  </li>
  <li>25 concepts passed: C+  </li>
  <li>23 concepts passed: C  </li>
  <li>22 concepts passed: C–  </li>
  <li>20 concepts passed: D+</li>
  <li>19 concepts passed: D</li>
  <li>17 concepts passed: D–</li>
  <li>15 concepts passed: F+</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reassessment">Reassessment</h3>

<p>In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts <em>within two weeks</em> of the unit deadline. One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window. <em>Re</em>assessments are only permitted for concepts/skills that were assessed during the unit. (In other words, only concepts/skills with a mark of A can be reassessed, not those with a mark of N.)</p>

<p>The reassessment must be <em>completed</em> within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor <em>immediately</em> to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.</p>
