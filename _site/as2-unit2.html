<h1 id='unit_ii_basic_chromaticism_and_64_chords'>Unit II: Basic chromaticism and 6/4 chords</h1>

<p>Unit II will continue to reinforce basic concepts of diatonic melody and harmony and standard rhythm, as well as skills in performing and recognizing musical structures by ear. New topics inlcude the dotted-half-note beat in compound meter, basic melodic chromaticism (chromatic neighbor and passing tones), and 6/4 chords (passing, neighbor, and cadential).</p>

<h2 id='materials'>Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to exercises in the Berkowitz and/or Kazez texts, the following materials will be assigned or may supplement assigned materials in order to help you meet the goals outlined under <em>Concepts and assessment</em>, most of which can be found on Kris Shaffer&#8217;s <a href='http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship'>Musicianship Resources</a> website (which also contains helpful review materials). This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.</p>

<h2 id='concepts_and_assessment'>Concepts and assessment</h2>

<p>The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the <a href='/as2-assess.html'>assessment guide</a>) in Unit II are divided into three categories: <em>rhythm</em>, <em>melody</em>, and <em>harmony</em>. Those with deadlines in Unit II are listed below (though others will be addressed in class activities), followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as &#8220;I can &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<h4 id='rhythm'>Rhythm</h4>

<ul>
<li>perform straight, dotted, and syncopated rhythms in simple meter, from sight (half-note beats) – 1x.</li>

<li>perform straight, dotted, and syncopated rhythms in compound meter, from sight (dotted-half-note beats) – 1x.</li>

<li>dictate/transcribe straight and dotted rhythms in compound meter, quickly and without an instrument (dotted-half-note beats) – 1x.</li>

<li>dictate/transcribe syncopated rhythms in compound meter, quickly and without an instrument (dotted-half-note beats) – 1x.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='melodic_pitch_elements'>Melodic pitch elements</h4>

</ul>

<h4 id='harmonic_pitch_elements'>Harmonic pitch elements</h4>

<ul>
<li>perform keyboard-style progressions containing 5/3 chords, 6/3 chords, inversions of V<sup>7</sup>, and passing and neighbor 6/4 chords, with preparation – 1x.</li>

<li>perform keyboard-style progressions containing 5/3 chords, 6/3 chords, and inversions of V<sup>7</sup>, and passing, neighbor, and cadential 6/4 chords while singing, with preparation – 1x.</li>

</ul>

<p>In-class or take-home/online assessment activities will be given for all of these concepts and skills, as well as some concepts and skills that have deadlines in future units. These assignments and quizzes will provide sufficient opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery by the unit deadline. Additional attempts then become the responsibility of the student to be submitted or performed during office hours.</p>
