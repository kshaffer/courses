<h1 id="unit-iv-more-applied-chords">Unit IV: More applied chords</h1>

<p>Unit IV will continue to reinforce basic concepts of diatonic melody and harmony and standard rhythm, as well as skills in performing and recognizing musical structures by ear. New topics inlcude the dotted-eighth-note beat in compound meter and melodic applied-chord arpeggios.</p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to exercises in the Berkowitz and/or Kazez texts, the following materials will be assigned or may supplement assigned materials in order to help you meet the goals outlined under <em>Concepts and assessment</em>, most of which can be found on Kris Shaffer’s <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship">Musicianship Resources</a> website (which also contains helpful review materials). This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.</p>

<p>(to be added during the unit)</p>

<h2 id="concepts-and-assessment">Concepts and assessment</h2>

<p>The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the <a href="/as2-assess.html">assessment guide</a>) in Unit II are divided into three categories: <em>rhythm</em>, <em>melody</em>, and <em>harmony</em>. Those with deadlines in Unit II are listed below (though others will be addressed in class activities), followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as “I can . . .”</p>

<h4 id="rhythm">Rhythm</h4>

<ul>
  <li>perform straight, dotted, and syncopated rhythms in compound meter, with preparation (dotted-eighth-note beats) – 1x.  </li>
  <li>dictate/transcribe straight and dotted rhythms in compound meter, quickly and without an instrument (dotted-eighth-note beats) – 1x.  </li>
  <li>dictate/transcribe syncopated rhythms in compound meter, quickly and without an instrument (dotted-eighth-note beats) – 1x.  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="melodic-pitch-elements">Melodic pitch elements</h4>

<ul>
  <li>perform diatonic melodies with chromatic incomplete neighbor tones, with preparation – 1x.  </li>
  <li>perform diatonic melodies with arpeggiations of applied/secondary-dominant chords, with preparation – 1x.  </li>
  <li>perform diatonic melodies with any triadic arpeggiations, from sight – 1x.  </li>
  <li>perform diatonic melodies with chromatic complete-neighbor and passing tones, from sight – 1x.  </li>
  <li>perform diatonic melodies with chromatic incomplete neighbor tones, from sight – 1x.  </li>
  <li>dictate/transcribe diatonic melodies with arpeggiations of applied/secondary-dominant chords, quickly and without an instrument – 2x.  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="harmonic-pitch-elements">Harmonic pitch elements</h4>

<ul>
  <li>recognize simple, closely related modulation types by ear, quickly and without an instrument – 2x.  </li>
</ul>

<p>In-class or take-home/online assessment activities will be given for all of these concepts and skills. These assignments and quizzes will provide sufficient opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery by the unit deadline. Additional attempts then become the responsibility of the student to be submitted or performed during office hours.</p>
