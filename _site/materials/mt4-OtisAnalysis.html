<h2>Otis analysis - April 21 and 23 (Music Theory IV)</h2>

<h3>Monday in class</h3>

<p>I will be out for a funeral on Monday. Laura will collect your assignments and lead the class through two activities.</p>

<p>First, there will be a quiz on pop/rock harmonic schemas. You will hear several excerpts, two times each, and identify the harmonic schema in the excerpt. The schemas are listed <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/popRockHarmony.html">here</a>. I recommend having the resource open during the quiz.</p>

<p>Second, in groups of 2–3 students (please, no one working alone during class), attempt to identify the theme of the following two songs&#39; lyrics. (You may want to review last semester&#39;s <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/analyzingPoetry.html">&quot;Analyzing poetry&quot;</a> resource.) Once you have an idea what you think the theme is, comment on <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cfibdbg2dmpapt5ga5rdjb05720">the G+ post</a> with your theme. Only one group member needs to comment, but include everyone&#39;s names, so we know whom to respond to in discussion.</p>

<p>Otis Redding, &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;: <a href="http://rock.rapgenius.com/Otis-redding-try-a-little-tenderness-lyrics">lyrics</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXmLjbTBcdU">audio</a><br>
Kanye West &amp; Jay-Z, &quot;Otis&quot;: <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-otis-lyrics">lyrics</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoEKWtgJQAU">video</a></p>

<p><em>Please note there are some explicit lyrics in this song, but it is fairly mild for the genre.</em></p>

<p>Feel free to look at the RapGenius annotations for &quot;Otis&quot; if you have difficulty understanding the lyrics.</p>

<h3>Homework for Wednesday</h3>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cfibdbg2dmpapt5ga5rdjb05720">Read each other&#39;s attempts at a theme</a> for these songs and <em>+1</em> or reply as appropriate. Then read <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/03/jay-z-and-kanye-west-a-response-to-ethan-hein/">a short blog post</a> I wrote this spring about these two songs. Lastly, based on your analysis and my blog post (or your disagreement with my blog post), come up with a single-sentence thesis statement for a hypothetical analysis of &quot;Otis.&quot; We will discuss these thesis statements and the supporting analyses in class on Wednesday. (In preparation for your final paper, which will be on a different song.)</p>
