<h3 id="monday-in-class">Monday in class</h3>

<p>I will be out for a funeral on Monday. Laura will collect your assignments and lead the class through two activities.</p>

<p>First, there will be a quiz on pop/rock harmonic schemas. You will hear several excerpts, two times each, and identify the harmonic schema in the excerpt. The schemas are listed <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/popRockHarmony.html">here</a>. I recommend having the resource open during the quiz.</p>

<p>Second, in groups of 2–3 students (please, no one working alone during class), attempt to identify the theme of the following two songs’ lyrics. (You may want to review last semester’s <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/analyzingPoetry.html">“Analyzing poetry”</a> resource.) Once you have an idea what you think the theme is, comment on <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cfibdbg2dmpapt5ga5rdjb05720">the G+ post</a> with your theme. Only one group member needs to comment, but include everyone’s names, so we know whom to respond to in discussion.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Otis Redding, “Try a Little Tenderness”: <a href="http://rock.rapgenius.com/Otis-redding-try-a-little-tenderness-lyrics">lyrics</a></td>
      <td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXmLjbTBcdU">audio</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Kanye West &amp; Jay-Z, “Otis”: <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-otis-lyrics">lyrics</a></td>
      <td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoEKWtgJQAU">video</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><em>Please note there are some explicit lyrics in this song, but it is fairly mild for the genre.</em></p>

<p>Feel free to look at the RapGenius annotations for “Otis” if you have difficulty understanding the lyrics.</p>

<h3 id="homework-for-wednesday">Homework for Wednesday</h3>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cfibdbg2dmpapt5ga5rdjb05720">Read each other’s attempts at a theme</a> for these songs and <em>+1</em> or reply as appropriate. Then read <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/03/jay-z-and-kanye-west-a-response-to-ethan-hein/">a short blog post</a> I wrote this spring about these two songs. Lastly, based on your analysis and my blog post (or your disagreement with my blog post), come up with a single-sentence thesis statement for a hypothetical analysis of “Otis.” We will discuss these thesis statements and the supporting analyses in class on Wednesday. (In preparation for your final paper, which will be on a different song.)</p>
