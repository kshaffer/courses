<p>For <strong>Monday, September 29, 9am</strong>, please do the following:</p>

<p>Listen to “We Can Work It Out” by The Beatles and “Pride (In the Name of Love)” by U2. Audio files for both songs are in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cT29FblliMTk0NUE&amp;authuser=1">class shared folder on Google Drive</a>. (Please download to your device before listening. If too many people access the files repeatedly in the shared folder, Google will lock it down and prohibit access.)</p>

<p>For each song, construct a timeline analysis of the song’s form using Variations Audio Timeliner. If VAT does not work on your computer, please use the CAML lab if possible. Otherwise, paper timelines are acceptable, but submit them electronically following the instructions below (here are <a href="http://courses.shaffermusic.com/materials/timeline-blank.pdf">blank timelines</a> to print).</p>

<p>For paper timelines, bracket phrases and modules, and label them as discussed in the <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html">Pop/rock form resource</a> (capital letters for modules according to function—I, O, A, B, etc.—and lower-case letters showing phrase relationships—aa’b, srdc, etc.). Then label each cycle in curly brackets at the beginning of the cycle, and write the name of the overall song form at the top of the (first) page of the timeline. Here is <a href="/materials/charlieBrown.pdf">an example paper timeline analysis</a> of “Charlie Brown” by The Coasters.</p>

<p>If using Variations Audio Timeliner, follow the instructions in <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/VAT.html">this video</a> and be sure to create layers for phrases, modules, cycles, and the overall song form, and label them as discussed in the <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm.html">Pop/rock form resource</a> (capital letters for modules according to function—I, O, A, B, etc.—and lower-case letters showing phrase relationships—aa’b, srdc, etc.). There is an example analysis of “The Moment I Said It” in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cT29FblliMTk0NUE&amp;authuser=1">class shared folder on Google Drive</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure the file is named “LASTNAME - Song Title”, and then upload it to Google Drive and share it with me (kris.shaffer@colorado.edu). You do not need to upload the audio, only the .v2t file.</p>

<p>As always, you are encouraged to study together, but assessments should be completed individually (though you may consult written resources as you work). Please keep the CU honor code in mind as you work.</p>

<p>This is the first of three take-home assessments, and it covers the following four assessment categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>large-scale song forms  </li>
  <li>formal cycles  </li>
  <li>formal modules  </li>
  <li>formal phrases</li>
</ul>
