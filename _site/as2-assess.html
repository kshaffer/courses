<p>Coursework will be divided into four units, or cycles, ending in weeks 3, 7, 11, and 15.</p>

<p>Assessment will be performed in reference to three categories of musical skills and concepts: </p>

<ul>
  <li><em>rhythm</em>  </li>
  <li><em>melodic pitch elements</em>  </li>
  <li><em>harmonic pitch elements</em>  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each category contains between 9 and 15 specific concepts or skills. At any point in the semester, for each concept/skill, students will have a current mark of <strong>N – not attempted</strong>, <strong>A – attempted</strong>, or <strong>P – passed</strong>. A student’s letter grade for a given category will be determined by the number of concepts/skills s/he has mastered (grade of P) by the end of the unit, by percentage (90/80/70/60). <em>Only the most recent assessment attempt(s) will count toward the letter grade.</em></p>

<p>See <a href="/auralskills2.html">syllabus</a> for final grade and reassessment information.</p>

<p>The concepts/skills for each category are listed below, followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). The concept/skills are also listed according to unit deadline. Assessment opportunities for these concepts/skills will take place in the units listed, but possibly in earlier units as well.</p>

<p>Read all as “I can . . .”</p>
