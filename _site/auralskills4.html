<h3>Musical concepts and fluency</h3>

<p>The goal of this course is musical fluency: that is, the successful depositing of musical information into readily-accessible long-term memory, and the successful cognitive assimilation of musical concepts and structures.
We will seek an advanced level of fluency in tonal music (with chromaticism and modulation) - Unit I (roughly weeks 1–8), and an introductory level of fluency with basic elements of post-tonal music – Unit II (roughly weeks 9–15).</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>Assessment will be performed in reference to four categories of musical skills and concepts: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>modulation</em> (Unit I)<br></li>
<li><em>harmony</em> (Unit I)<br></li>
<li><em>post-tonal pitch materials</em> (Unit II)<br></li>
<li><em>advanced rhythm and meter</em> (Unit II) </li>
</ul>

<p>Each category contains between three and five specific concepts or skills (see unit guides). At any point in the semester, for each category/skill, students will have a current mark of <strong>N – not attempted</strong>, <strong>A – attempted</strong>, <strong>B – borderline</strong>, or <strong>P – passed</strong>.</p>

<p>A student’s letter grade for a given category is determined by the number of those specific concepts or skills for which the student demonstrates mastery (mark of P – passed) by the end of the appropriate unit of study, according to the following scale:</p>

<ul>
<li>A: mastery of all concepts/skills in the category<br></li>
<li>B: mastery of all but one<br></li>
<li>C: mastery of all but two<br></li>
<li>D: mastery of all but three<br></li>
<li>F: anything less than D</li>
</ul>

<p>A <em>borderline</em> assessment counts for half of a <em>passing</em> assessment. All passing except for two borderline counts for a B, not a C, for example.</p>

<p>Generally, students will be given at least two or three opportunities during each unit to demonstrate mastery of each concept, and only their performance on the <em>most recent</em> assessment attempt(s) will count towards the unit grade. More details are provided in the unit guides.</p>

<p>A student&#39;s overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of all unit grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest unit grade—whichever is lower.</p>

<h3>Reassessment</h3>

<p>In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts <em>within two weeks</em> of the unit deadline. One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window.</p>

<p>The reassessment must be <em>completed</em> within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor <em>immediately</em> to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.</p>
