<h2 id="musical-concepts-and-fluency">Musical concepts and fluency</h2>

<p>The goal of this course is musical fluency: that is, the successful depositing of musical information into readily-accessible long-term memory, and the successful cognitive assimilation of musical concepts and structures.</p>

<p>We will seek an advanced level of fluency in tonal music (with chromaticism and modulation) - Unit I (roughly weeks 1–7), and an introductory level of fluency with basic elements of post-tonal music – Unit II (roughly weeks 8–15).</p>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>Assessment will be performed in reference to four categories of musical skills and concepts: </p>

<ul>
  <li><em>modulation</em> (Unit I)  </li>
  <li><em>post-tonal pitch materials</em> (Unit II)  </li>
  <li><em>advanced rhythm and meter</em> (Unit II) </li>
</ul>

<p>Each category contains between three and five specific concepts or skills (see unit guides). At any point in the semester, for each category/skill, students will have a current mark of <strong>N – not attempted</strong>, <strong>A – attempted</strong>, or <strong>P – passed</strong>.</p>

<p>A student’s letter grade for a given category is determined by the number of those specific concepts or skills for which the student demonstrates mastery (mark of P – passed) by the end of the appropriate unit of study, according to the following scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: mastery of all concepts/skills in the category  </li>
  <li>B: mastery of all but one  </li>
  <li>C: mastery of all but two  </li>
  <li>D: mastery of all but three  </li>
  <li>F: anything less than D</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, students will be given multiple opportunities during each unit to demonstrate mastery of each concept, and only their performance on the <em>most recent</em> assessment attempt(s) will count towards the unit grade. More details are provided in the unit guides.</p>

<p><strong>A student’s overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of all unit grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest unit grade — whichever is lower.</strong></p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>To receive a final grade of A, a student needs a median grade of A for the three unit grades, and nothing lower than a B. So A A A, or A A B for the three unit grades would resuli in a final grade of A.</p>

<p>To receive a final grade of B, a student needs a median unit grade of B, and nothing lower than a C. So unit grades of A B B, A B C, B B B, or B B C would result in a final grade of B.</p>

<h2 id="reassessment">Reassessment</h2>

<p>In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts <em>within two weeks</em> of the unit deadline. One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window.</p>

<p>The reassessment must be <em>completed</em> within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor <em>immediately</em> to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.</p>
