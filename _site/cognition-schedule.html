<h2 id="finals-week">Finals week</h2>

<p>Please upload your final post or “expanded synthesis” to the class blog by <strong>Wednesday, Dec. 17, 8am.</strong> Also by Wednesday morning, please email me a brief summary of your project work. This need only be a copy of the following list with links to your materials that support it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blog posts published (2–3)  </li>
  <li>class discussions led (2)  </li>
  <li>comments left on others’ posts (tweets are also fine) (at least 2)  </li>
</ul>

<p>This will help me make sure I don’t miss anything as I submit final grades. More importantly, it will help you make sure that you’ve done everything that is required for the grade you want. (See the <a href="cognition.html">syllabus</a> for grade details, as we decided in class on October 31.) Let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<h2 id="november-14-prep">November 14 prep</h2>

<p>If you are on the schedule to lead discussion this week (LE, LS, TK, JJ, MA), please complete your write-up and submit it into the class WordPress website or the Google Drive folder by <strong>Wednesday, 10am.</strong> Then be prepared to lead discussion for 25–30 minutes of class. This can begin with a brief introduction on your part, or a response to comments left on your write-up, but otherwise it should be open for full-class discussion.</p>

<p>All members of the class should read all posts. Posts will be published on the <a href="http://shaffermusic.com/muscog/">class Wordpress blog</a>. Please submit write-ups by posting them there, or by posting them to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cTDlyeURLcHdxQ28&amp;usp=sharing">Google Drive folder</a>. And be sure to check in both places when reading materials for Friday.</p>

<p>If you are not on the schedule to write/lead this week, please comment on at least two of the posts. (Try to ensure that each post gets at least one comment by someone other than me.) Then come to class ready to discuss what you read or ask questions of the researcher that wrote it.</p>

<h2 id="october-31-prep">October 31 prep</h2>

<p>We will spend the bulk of class negotiating final project expectations—both the content/goals, and the assessment standards/procedures. This is where you all should really take over in leading the class as much as possible, with me here to support your work (and to ensure institutionally that appropriate standards of education are being met).</p>

<p>For next time, please mull over possible final project ideas—either individual projects, small-group projects, or whole-class projects. Consider what they might look like, how we might schedule work,presentations, papers, online publications, etc. And try to get at least a preliminary grasp of what the “state of the field” looks like for the topic(s) you are considering.</p>

<p>Please add any ideas, definitive articles/books, etc. to <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1wktTcnnqiMvWHjwCh550P9BtxKPnUM0emKTFTvXHNtk/edit?usp=sharing">the Google Doc that I slaved over this afternoon.</a> Try to do so by Wednesday, 10am (our usual quiz deadline), and then use Wednesday and/or Thursday to look over each other’s ideas, offer suggestions, read articles that are shared…anything that can help you come prepared for our negotiation session on Friday.</p>

<p>Finally, the following are the articles/books shared during class today (taken from the Twitter stream):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://t.co/JyDYdonP96">“My pretent music school”</a>  </li>
  <li><a href="http://t.co/s9whZGhxkn"><em>Repeating Ourselves</em></a>  </li>
  <li><a href="http://ww2.coastal.edu/dsmith/edet720/ausubelref.htm">“The Learning Theories of David P. Ausubel: The Importance of Meaningful and Reception Learning”</a>  </li>
  <li><a href="http://t.co/6A80KiPykE">“Practice for knowledge (not drill and kill)”</a>  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.academia.edu/5008839/Mental_practice_in_music_memorization_An_ecological-empirical_study">“Mental practice in music memorization”</a>  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="october-24-prep">October 24 prep</h2>

<p>There will be no quiz this week. Instead, we’ll do a few short readings in support of a focus on some key questions that you brought to class or arose in class on 10/17. Those questions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sight-reading is a professional activity that is discriminatory against musicians with certain cognitive differences. What is the most just response to that reality for our students: 1) to discourage students with those differences/disabilities from pursuing a career that requires sight-reading? or 2) to cultivate pedagogical strategies that can help those students develop cognitive and professional work-arounds? (And if the latter, what might those strategies be?)  </li>
  <li>How can we use our new-found knowledge of memory and cognition to help ourselves and our students to memorize music more effectively?  </li>
  <li>What are the cognitive dangers of an excess of rote learning? (Suzuki string method, disproportionate focus on marching band or on performance over creative and critical activities, etc.) How can we compensate for those dangers in our own musical practice and our teaching?  </li>
  <li>Are “learning styles” real? If so/if not, how does that impact our teaching?</li>
</ul>

<p>Before Friday, please read the following and come prepared to discuss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kris Shaffer, <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2013/04/promoting-musical-fluency-or-why-i-de-emphasize-sight-singing-and-dictation-in-class/">“Promoting musical fluency -or- Why I de-emphasize sight-singing and dictation in class”</a>  </li>
  <li>Howard Gardner, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/">“‘Multiple intelligences’ are not ‘learning styles’”</a>  </li>
  <li>Association for Psychological Science, <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/learning-styles-debunked-there-is-no-evidence-supporting-auditory-and-visual-learning-psychologists-say.html">“Learning Styles Debunked: There is No Evidence Supporting Auditory and Visual Learning, Psychologists Say”</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.udlcenter.org/aboutudl/udlguidelines">Universal Design for Learning, Guidelines 2.0</a> (be sure to follow the “learn more” links for each of the guidelines)</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, choose one of the four questions above and seek out a helpful resource that speaks to that question. Come prepared to share insights from that resource.</p>

<p>Because of the diffuse nature of this assignment, and because 3 hours is not enough time to discuss all of this in depth, please feel free to read early and tweet your thoughts/questions using the #muscog hashtag. :)</p>

</ul>

<p><strong><em>By Wednesday, 10am</em></strong>, submit three factual questions about the readings (one question per reading) to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1gG6gjxMhbQnwSONUAsm4scxsCZjLtoCbZHWZXyVA1_M/edit?usp=sharing">quiz preparation Google Doc</a> for the week. Your quiz cannot count as passing if you do not submit these questions on time. </p>

<p>Then find and memorize answers to all of the questions in the document and be prepared to answer them on a quiz at the beginning of Friday’s class. (I will choose 9–10 of your 24 questions.)</p>

<p>Finally, bring to class a question to which you would like to pursue an answer about either <em>pedagogy</em> or <em>learning disabilities</em> in relation to music cognition. These could be things like <em>How can I better teach my students [concept/skill]?</em> or <em>How does [learning disability] affect [musical skill]?</em> We won’t answer all of them in class on Friday! But we can start to open up a few of them, and perhaps get some mental juices going for final projects.</p>

Your quiz cannot count as passing if you do not submit these questions on time. </p>

<p>Please focus your questions on what you find to be the most important issues in this text. There are a lot of terms defined and experiments described, not all of which need to be memorized. Simply focus on what seems to be foundational, what strikes you as interesting, or what you think would be the most useful to know given your particular musical goals.</p>

<p>Also, start to mull over possible individual, small-group, or large-group project ideas for the end of the semester. We’ll discuss things as they come up, and plan on finalizing plans on October 31.</p>
