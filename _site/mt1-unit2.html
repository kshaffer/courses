<h1 id="unit-ii-strict-composition-in-two-voices">Unit II: Strict composition in two voices</h1>

<p>When we engage music as listeners, composers, performers, scholars, our brains generate expectations about notes, chords, melodies, chord progressions, instrumentation, large-scale form, etc. Some of these expectations are hard-wired and naturally selected, others are learned in the course of our individual lives. All of them shape the way we experience music. And all of them are in competition with each other.</p>

<p>Strict composition is a musical activity that helps us begin to learn how to mediate these conflicts, in order to produce a musical whole that both challenges and pleases the listener. Its most direct application is in “free” composition (composing music in real styles, as opposed to “strict” styles for the purposes of learning). However, the principles we explore in strict composition will help us better understand the music we perform and teach, which will in turn help us to perform, arrange, critique, and teach it in more musically mature ways.</p>

<h2 id="concepts-and-assessment">Concepts and assessment</h2>

<p><strong>We will engage three concepts in this unit that will contribute to C-level contract assessments.</strong> They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>cantus firmus</strong> – compose and perform (video) a well formed <em>cantus firmus</em> in a major key and another in a minor key, with a partner.  </li>
  <li><strong>first species</strong> – compose and perform (video) a well formed first-species counterpoint exercise in a major key and another in a minor key, with a partner. One exercise should have the counterpoint above the CF, the other below.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We will engage two concepts in this unit that will contribute to B-level contract assessments.</strong> They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>second species</strong> – compose and perform (video) a well formed second-species counterpoint exercise in a major key and another in a minor key, with a partner. One exercise should have the counterpoint above the CF, the other below.  </li>
  <li><strong>fourth species</strong> – compose and perform (video) a well formed fourth-species counterpoint exercise in a major key and another in a minor key, with a partner. One exercise should have the counterpoint above the CF, the other below.   </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To obtain an A in this course,</strong> a student must fulfill all B-level objectives from Units II and III, as well as the following, which includes work from Unit II:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose four voice-leading principles (two from strict two-voice composition, two from strict four-voice composition). For each one, write no more than a paragraph explaining how that principle relates to one or more concepts of music perception and cognition, and compare/contrast that relationship to a pattern/rule/principle in a free musical style (classical keyboard, opera, choral, pop/rock, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>C- and B-level work must be completed <em>in order</em>: cantus firmus, first species, second, third, fourth. We will spend two class meetings engaging each concept, after which assessments may be attempted. Student partnerships can submit work relating to <em>a single concept</em> at the beginning of each class. If an assessment doesn’t pass on the first attempt, they can (must) be re-attempted before going on to the next concept. Since only one assessment attempt can be submitted each class meeting, it is important not to fall behind, so that class activities support the out-of-class work you are currently doing.</p>

<p>All Unit II concepts must be passed <em>by the end of Unit II.</em></p>

<p>A-level work can be submitted at any time in Unit II, Unit III, or Finals Week, <em>after the B-level work for that unit is completed</em>.</p>

<p>See <a href="theory1.html">syllabus</a> for end-of-unit reassessment policy.</p>
