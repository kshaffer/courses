<p>Course title: Semester 4 Theory<br />Course number: MUSC 2111<br />Semester: Spring 2013<br />Meeting time: MW 10:00am–10:50am<br />Meeting location: MUS C191<br />Instructor: <a href='http://kris.shaffermusic.com'>Kris Shaffer, Ph.D.</a><br />Office: MUS N138<br />Office hours: by appointment<br />Course website: <a href='http://courses.shaffermusic.com/'>courses.shaffermusic.com</a><br />Online community: <a href='https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/118350994807708327963'>Google Plus</a></p>

<h3 id='unit_topics'>Unit topics</h3>

<p>This course will focus on the normative harmonic, melodic, and formal structures of multiple musical styles, with a view towards understanding both the <em>general</em> traits that underly most of Western tonal and post-tonal music, and the <em>specific</em> traits that are typical of two specific styles of Western tonal music. In order to accomplish this, the course will be divided into three units, each covering a single style of music:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit I: Classical form (themes and sonatas)</li>

<li>Unit II: Introduction to post-tonal music</li>

<li>Unit III: Pop/rock form</li>
</ul>

<p>More details are provided in the three unit guides.</p>

<h3 id='assessment'>Assessment</h3>

<p>Each student will receive a single letter grade for each unit, based on the number of musical concepts a student has mastered by the unit deadline. Those musical concepts are listed in each unit&#8217;s guide (see above). Generally, students will be given at least two opportunities during each unit to demonstrate mastery of each concept, and only their performance on the <em>most recent</em> assessment attempt will count towards the unit grade. More details are provided in the unit guides.</p>

<p>A student&#8217;s overall grade at the end of the semester will be the median of all unit grades, or one letter grade higher than the lowest unit grade—whichever is lower.</p>

<h3 id='reassessment'>Reassessment</h3>

<p>In general, students will have multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery of a set of musical concepts throughout a unit of study. If a student is not satisfied with their level of mastery and their letter grade at the end of a unit, that student may reassess the relevant concepts <em>within two weeks</em> of the unit deadline. One reassessment opportunity is allowed automatically. However, if a student makes progress on that reassessment but some concepts still remain to be mastered, the instructor may allow, at his discretion, another reassessment opportunity within another two-week window.</p>

<p>The reassessment must be <em>completed</em> within two weeks of the unit deadline. Students wishing to reassess one or more concepts should contact the instructor <em>immediately</em> to schedule a reassessment time and agree on an appropriate reassessment task.</p>
