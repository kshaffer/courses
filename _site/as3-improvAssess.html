<p>You will be provided with a key, a meter, and a chain of 2–3 schemata that can be used as the underpinning of an 8-bar <em>non-modulating</em> sentence. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meyer – 5-stage Prinner  </li>
  <li>Aprile – Passo Indietro – Compound HC</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you will be given roughly one minute to think through options. Following that, inform your instructor which grade-level you are aiming for (see <a href="as3-unit2.html">Unit II Guide</a>), then count off an appropriate tempo for your melody. Your instructor will accompany you with the appropriate harmonic progression for your schema chain, while you improvise a melody over it without stopping. </p>

<p>If your melody fits the schemas provided <em>and</em> follows the mold of a sentence (two melodically related basic ideas followed by continuation material and an appropriate cadence), and meets the complexity level of the grade level you chose, you will receive that grade.</p>

<p>Since you have a second attempt later in the unit, you are more than welcome to attempt a lower grade level for practice and to ensure at least a medium grade for the unit. You may also attempt a higher grade and, if successful, you will not need the second attempt.</p>

<p>You may perform by singing with solfège or playing on an instrument of your choice.</p>

<p>All schemas will be chosen from those on the <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/schemataSummary.html">schema summary page on OMT</a>, and there is both instructional material and play-along audio for practice on the <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html">Improvising a sentence</a> page.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
