# Unit II: Introduction to post-tonal music #

Unit II will comprise an introduction to the performance and aural recognition of some common post-tonal pitch materials and asymmetrical meters and rhythms.

## Materials ##

The following materials will be assigned or may supplement assigned materials in order to help you meet the goals outlined under *Concepts and assessment*, most of which can be found on [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com) (which also contains helpful review materials). This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.

[Modes and cells video portfolio instructions](materials/as4-unit2modeVideos.html) (the modes listed there will also be those used for the recognition quizzes, transcription assignments, and musical performances)  

[Analyzying atonal music](http://openmusictheory.com/atonal.html) – basic information that will be helpful in understanding the pitch concepts we will be performing and transcribing.  
[Advanced Meter (Gary Karpinski)](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/file/d/0B9o4hmKNoi6cVEE2R1FaU3d5ZGM/view?usp=sharing) (in the class shared folder on Google Drive, CU IdentiKey login required to view)

## Concepts and assessment ##

The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the [syllabus]({{ root_url }}/auralskills4.html)) are divided into two categories: *post-tonal pitch materials* and *advanced rhythm and meter*. They are listed below, followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as "I can . . ."

**Post-tonal pitch materials (Unit II)**

- recognize common modes and cells in a musical passage by ear – pass 1 quiz  
- transcribe music making use of common modes and cells (no instrument or time constraints) – pass 2 take-home transcription assignments  
- perform common modes and cells in isolation (sung) – create 1 [video portfolio](materials/as4-unit2modeVideos.html)  
- perform music that makes use of common modes and cells with preparation (instrument of choice) – pass 1 video performance  
- perform music that makes use of common modes and cells from sight (instrument of choice) – pass 1 sight-reading exam  

**Advanced rhythm and meter (Unit II)**

- recognize common asymmetrical meters in a passage by ear (quintuple, septuple, changing, "asymmetrical compound") – pass 1 quiz  
- transcribe the rhythm of a melody/passage in a common asymmetrical meter – pass 2 take-home transcription assignments  
- perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters in a real piece of music with preparation (instrument of choice) – pass 1 video performance  
- perform standard rhythmic figures in common asymmetrical meters in a real piece of music from sight (instrument of choice) – pass 1 sight-reading exam

*N.B.: The same performance activity (video or sight-reading exam) can count for both pitch and rhythm.*

In-class or take-home/online assessment activities will be given for all of these concepts and skills. These assignments and quizzes will provide sufficient opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery by the unit deadline. Additional attempts then become the responsibility of the student to be submitted or performed during office hours.
