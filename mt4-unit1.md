# Unit I: Classical form (themes and sonatas) #

Unit I will cover classical form. We will review and build on the work you did on phrases, periods, and sentences in Semester 2 Theory; review and build on the concepts of harmonic prolongation and cadential progressions from Semester 3 Theory; and introduce and go into depth on the normative structures of sonata-form movements.

The overall goal for this unit is for all students to be able to identify the key structural elements of standard classical theme forms (phrases, sentences, periods, hybrid themes, and compound themes) and the key structural elements of sonata form in a classical sonata movement, as well as to comunicate verbally, in detail and with nuance, about those structures in classical pieces of moderate analytical difficulty.

The provisional end-of-unit deadline is Wednesday, February 12.

## Materials ##

We will be following the theories of [William E. Caplin](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2689355W/Classical_form) for our study of classical theme forms, and the theories of [James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4294182W/Elements_of_sonata_theory) for our study of sonata form. If you would like to study their theories in greater detail, or look up supplemental examples of what we engage in class, check out those book links. However, all required material for this unit will be posted on the course [Google Plus community](https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/118350994807708327963) page, most of which comes from my [Musicianship Resources](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship) website:

## Concepts ##

Our coursework in this unit will be directed towards to goal of consistent, correct identification and interpretation of the following concepts or structural elements in the context of classical-era pieces. Read as "I can identify and interpret . . ."

Classical themes:

- sub-phrases (basic ideas, contrasting ideas)  
- phrases (presentation, continuation, antecedent, consequent, compound basic idea)  
- themes (sentences, periods, hybrid themes, compound themes)  
- cadences (PAC, IAC, HC)  

Sonata-form movements:

- Exposition and recapitulation types (continuous, two-part, two-part with multiple MCs)  
- Modulations  
- Structural points of arrival (medial caesura, essential expositional closure, essential sonata closure, crux)  
- Theme-level modules (primary, transition, secondary, closing, TR=>FS, retransition)  
- Movement-level modules (exposition, development, recapitulation, introduction, coda)  
- correspondence, reference, and altered measures  

## Assessment ##

Beginning in Week 2, there will be weekly quizzes in which you will have an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the above concepts by identifying them in pieces of music not covered in class. You will receive at least two quiz opportunities for each concept during the unit. (Quiz concepts will be announced in advance.) Upon taking the quiz, you will receive one of the following marks for each concept: **P – passing**, **A - attempted**, or **N – not attempted**. 

Your unit grade will take into account only your mark for the *most recent quiz* that covered a given concept. If you do not take a quiz, your marks from the previous quiz will be taken. (So, for example, if you pass all categories before the last quiz, you can skip that quiz. Likewise, if you miss the first quiz for a set of concepts, you can "make it up" by taking the next quiz.)

Unit letter grades will be determined by the number of concepts you have passed by the final quiz:

- B: 9 or 10 concepts passing  
- C: 7 or 8 concepts passing  
- D: 5 or 6 concepts passing  
- F: 4 or fewer concepts passing

If at the end of the unit you have a B, you will be eligible to attempt an A by doing the project below.

If at the end of the unit you have a C or lower, you may take advantage of the reassessment opportunity described on the syllabus.

If at the end of the unit you are happy with your grade, you can do nothing and keep it.

## End-of-unit project ##

Eligible students can submit a sonata project *one week after the final unit quiz* to attempt a unit grade of A. To obtain an A for the unit, a student must pass 9 or 10 concepts on the unit quizzes and do the following: 

- Find a sonata-form movement with complex or ambiguous features.  
- Produce a timeline (paper or digital) accurately labeling all 10 conceptual elements in that movement.  
- Write a short paper (800 words maximum) or produce a short video (5 minutes maximum) explaining ambiguous elements in the movement—either the thought process that went into choosing the labels you chose on your timeline for ambiguous passages, or explaining the musical significance of complex elements that resisted clear timeline labels.

To accomodate end-of-unit projects and reassessments, the first week of Unit II will have minimal or no assigned out-of-class work.
