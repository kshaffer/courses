## Prep for January 20/21 (Tuesday/Wednesday)

Please read the following:  

- [Analyzing poetry](http://openmusictheory.com/analyzingPoetry.html) on *Open Music Theory*, a short but helpful guide by Jonathan Sircy, English professor at my former institution.  
- [The Twitter Essay](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/the-twitter-essay/), an introduction to what we'll be doing with Twitter this semester, by Jesse Stommel.

Optional: You may be interested in reading/listening to Jonathan's new article in the journal *Hybrid Pedagogy*: [Faithful Listening.](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/faithful-listening/) It may be a helpful guide to engaging texts and texted music this semester, as well as an insight into what your professors are (and aren't) doing when they grade your written work. :)

## Prep for January 14/15

Please read the [syllabus](theory4.html) and [writing guide](mt4-writing.html), and bring any questions you have about them to class on Wednesday/Thursday.
