Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## Prep for February 2/3

Download a score for Johannes Brahms's "Lerchengesang," (movement 2 of his [Op. 70 song cycle](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/3/32/IMSLP77280-PMLP52805-Brahms_Werke_Band_25_Breitkopf_JB_154_Op_70_filter.pdf)), read the [text and translation](http://www.recmusic.org/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=3582) (by Karl Candidus), and listen to a recording of it.

Spotify URI: spotify:track:5gMScqEe1pZCyM0kGZlosr  
Spotify web player URL: http://open.spotify.com/track/5gMScqEe1pZCyM0kGZlosr

Then take [an online quiz](http://goo.gl/forms/iFbFHNgrrW) about the musical structure of the song. This will serve two purposes: preparing for more in-depth discussion, as well as an assessment opportunity for the Unit I musical course objectives.

Finally, consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a blog post, Twitter essay, or blog revisions, please see the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your written work according to the instructions provided there. 


## Prep for January 28/29

Consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). 

If you are due for a Twitter essay, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there. Possible topics include "Gretchen am Spinnrade," "Erlkönig," the general nature of poetry, and basic ideas on the setting of poetry to music. ***Say as much as you can within the 140-character constraint.*** Use each character, word, hashtag strategically. There is no need for filler. On the contrary, the delete button will be your friend.

If you are due for blog comments, please check your email for a notification, or login to Google Drive and click on "Incoming" or "Shared with me." You will have a classmate's blog post shared with you. Open it, read it, and leave at least one substantive comment to help them improve their writing. See the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) for more details.

If your group is due for a Wikipedia edit, please see the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and apply them to [the Wikipedia article on "Erlkönig."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Erlk%C3%B6nig) (Focus on the section labeled "The Franz Schubert composition.") Be prepared to present what you updated and why *briefly* in class on Wednesday/Thursday.

Everyone else, please review the Google Doc from class (in the shared folder), and come prepared to discuss the song in more detail and to respond to your classmates' Wikipedia updates. In particular think about:

- Who is in control of the tonality of the song? In other words, which characters seem to be able to stay in a key for a long time, to bring it to a cadence? Which characters begin in keys set by others? Which characters can begin in any key the choose?

## Prep for January 20/21 (Tuesday/Wednesday)

Please read the following:  

- [Analyzing poetry](http://openmusictheory.com/analyzingPoetry.html) on *Open Music Theory*, a short but helpful guide by Jonathan Sircy, English professor at my former institution.  
- [The Twitter Essay](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/the-twitter-essay/), an introduction to what we'll be doing with Twitter this semester, by Jesse Stommel.

Then take a stab at completing a Twitter essay (by yourself or with your group from class) that sums up, exemplifies, or engages something from Monday's/Tuesday's class. Use the hashtags #TwitterEssay and #poetry in your Twitter essay. You can bring them to class on paper, in the Google Doc we worked in during class, or you can tweet them from your own account.

Optional: You may be interested in reading/listening to Jonathan's new article in the journal *Hybrid Pedagogy*: [Faithful Listening.](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/faithful-listening/) It may be a helpful guide to engaging texts and texted music this semester, as well as an insight into what your professors are (and aren't) doing when they grade your written work. :)

## Prep for January 14/15

Please read the [syllabus](theory4.html) and [writing guide](mt4-writing.html), and bring any questions you have about them to class on Wednesday/Thursday.

Optionally, sign up for a [Twitter](http://twitter.com) account that you would like to use for this class. 

If you will be using Twitter for this class, please [add your username/handle to this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xqbqYU89V50G9LDg5fEh5OUYA05QfCjXVZEiN6ci5EQ/viewform?usp=send_form).
