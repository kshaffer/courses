## Prep for March 11/12

Consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing), and if scheduled, submit a Twitter essay. 

If you submitted a blog post for 3/2 or 3/3, you should have comments from your colleagues now. Please revise based on those comments and submit your revision by class time on March 11/12.

Everyone, please read the following:

- [Collections and scales](http://openmusictheory.com/scales2.html)  
- [Analyzing atonal music](http://openmusictheory.com/atonal.html) (stop at "Common operations")  
- Optional: ["Why grade?"](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/07/why-grade/)

In light of these readings, revisit Debussy's "La Cathédrale engloutie" and the discussion questions from class. Then [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qYyMgXNvw0dnJH8R-QaOlt7M9zMc2siCwPclwQHumds/viewform?usp=send_form) with your responses by 8am of the next class day (March 11/12). (This is not for a grade, just preparation for our next meeting.)

## Prep for March 9/10

See the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) for information on the Unit I paper. Consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing), and if scheduled, submit a Twitter essay.

## Prep for March 2/3

Monday's/Tuesday's class time will primarily be devoted to the final two movements of *Die schöne Müllerin*: "Der Müller und der Bach" and "Des Baches Wiegenlied." Please listen to both songs, study their text and music (see Feb 23/24 for text, score, and audio), and then take the [online quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jMrr1AIPIQrT7zn8Smy_daCcaeuKm0EzLkC9UBd-tOU/viewform?usp=send_form). For the quiz, focus on the areas that you have not yet passed for the unit (see assessment report). For class, come prepared to discuss those areas that you studied most closely as you worked on the quiz.

Also, please consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a Twitter essay or a blog post, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there.

If you submitted a blog post Feb 23/24, please revise it for Monday/Tuesday based on the comments received. Either update your Google doc to reflect the suggested improvement, or respectfully respond to the comment about why you choose not to make the revision. Then click "resolve" for each comment.

N.B.: There are wikipedia groups scheduled for 3/4, but since we will be doing paper consultations in lieu of that class meeting, I will be adjusting the schedule. I'll fill you in on that once it's updated, but no one will do wikipedia presentations next week.

## Prep for February 25/26

Consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a Twitter essay, Wikipedia presentation, or blog comments, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there.

Also, please look over the guidelines for the [Unit I academic paper](mt4-academicPaper.html). Each student must write one academic paper, but it is your choice whether you write it for Unit I or Unit II. Consult the guidelines and your assessment report (and me, if you are unsure) as you decide which unit to write the paper for.


## Prep for February 23/24

We will split our class time between discussing Wikipedia presentations (mainly on "Mondnacht") and exploring Schubert's song cycle, *Die schöne Müllerin*. We will engage the latter primarily through lecture. To prepare, please read [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_schöne_Müllerin) on the song cycle, download [the score](http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/f/f6/IMSLP03233-Schubert_dsm_em.pdf), and listen to the following two movements: "Die liebe Farbe" and "Die böse Farbe." (Text and translation for the entire cycle [can be found here](http://www.gopera.com/lieder/translations/schubert_795.pdf).) I highly recommend [Ian Bostridge's recording of this song cycle](http://open.spotify.com/user/kris.shaffer/playlist/1SaXv4tlZlW931nZ9a8q1o) (Spotify URI: spotify:user:kris.shaffer:playlist:1SaXv4tlZlW931nZ9a8q1o):

## Prep for February 18/19

First, please complete and reflect on [the analytical questions begun in class](materials/MondnachtAnalysis.pdf) on 2/16 and 2/17. Bring your completed and/or revised analysis to class on Wednesday/Thursday.

Consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a Twitter essay or blog comments, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there. *Please note that Wikipedia presentations originally scheduled for 2/18 and 2/19 have been pushed to 2/23 and 2/24.*


## Prep for February 16/17

First, please read the poem "Mondnacht" (or "Es war, als hätt' der Himmel") by Josef Karl Benedikt von Eichendorff, [and its translation](http://www.recmusic.org/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=5239). As much as you can, get a feel for the sound of the German, as well as the meaning in translation.

> Es war, als hätt' der Himmel,  
Die Erde still geküßt,  
Daß sie im Blütenschimmer  
Von ihm nun träumen müßt.  

> Die Luft ging durch die Felder,  
Die Ähren wogten sacht,  
Es rauschten leis die Wälder,  
So sternklar war die Nacht.  

> Und meine Seele spannte  
Weit ihre Flügel aus,  
Flog durch die stillen Lande,  
Als flöge sie nach Haus.

> It was as if the sky  
Had quietly kissed the earth,  
So that in a shower of blossoms  
She must only dream of him.

> The breeze wafted through the fields,  
The ears of corn waved gently,  
The forests rustled faintly,  
So sparkling clear was the night.

> And my soul stretched  
its wings out far,  
Flew through the still lands,  
as if it were flying home.

Then submit your responses to the questions in [**online quiz no. 1**](http://goo.gl/forms/EbXsjFLt0U) ***before you listen to the music or consult the scores***. This will prepare you for class activities on Monday/Tuesday.

Then, download scores to two settings, one by Brahms and one by Schumann. Listen to both and examine the scores. Then submit your responses to [**online quiz no. 2**](http://goo.gl/forms/tMP9SRG7po). This will both prepare you for class activities and provide an assessment opportunity for form, rhythm, and (if you provide enough analytical detail) harmony.

- [Brahms, "Mondnacht" score](http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/c/c0/IMSLP85499-PMLP52988-Brahms_Werke_Band_26_Breitkopf_JB_169_WoO_21_filter.pdf)  
- [Schumann, "Mondnacht" score](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/2/28/IMSLP51730-PMLP12741-RS127.pdf) (*Liederkreis*, no. 5)  
- [Brahms, "Mondnacht" recording](http://open.spotify.com/track/266suB9wmWDAQlbpWyecjZ) (Spotify URI: spotify:track:266suB9wmWDAQlbpWyecjZ)  
- [Schumann, "Mondnacht" recording](http://open.spotify.com/track/6PAES5xwJvXvf3HTAC56gI) (Spotify URI: spotify:track:6PAES5xwJvXvf3HTAC56gI)  
- [Online quiz 1](http://goo.gl/forms/EbXsjFLt0U) (text)  
- [Online quiz 2](http://goo.gl/forms/tMP9SRG7po) (musical features)

Finally, consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a Twitter essay or a blog post, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there. If you submitted a blog post last week, please revise it for Monday/Tuesday based on the comments received. Either update your Google doc to reflect the suggested improvement, or respectfully respond to the comment about why you choose not to make the revision. Then click "resolve" for each comment.

## Prep for February 11/12

Everyone, please review the class notes on "In der Fremde" from Monday/Tuesday (in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing)). Ponder the question given at the end of class and come prepared to discuss it.

Consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a Twitter essay, blog comments, or a Wikipedia edit/presentation, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there. 


## Prep for February 9/10

We will analyze Robert Schumann's "In der Fremde" (*Liederkreis*, movement 1). Following are resources for this song:

- [Score](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/2/28/IMSLP51730-PMLP12741-RS127.pdf) (IMSLP)  
- [Recording](http://open.spotify.com/track/545qYDn5M4HjbfcFRmvTP2) (Spotify URI: spotify:track:545qYDn5M4HjbfcFRmvTP2)  
- [Harmonic reduction](materials/InDerFremdeReduction.pdf)  
- [Text translation](http://www.recmusic.org/lieder/assemble_texts.html?LanguageId=7&SongCycleId=39&ContribId=1)  

> From the direction of home, behind the red flashes of lightning  
There come clouds,  
But Father and Mother are long dead;  
No one there knows me anymore.  

> How soon, ah, how soon will that quiet time come,  
When I too shall rest, and over me  
the beautiful forest's loneliness shall rustle,  
And no one here shall know me anymore.  

For Monday/Tuesday, listen to the song and compare the harmonic reduction to the score. Then take [the online quiz](http://goo.gl/forms/LlYcZkkYHI). The main task will be to explain verbally the harmonic reduction in light of the score. This will 1) help you better understand some of the difficult concepts we ran into with "Lerchengesang", and 2) give you an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of chromatic harmony without having to label chords. This will be an assessment opportunity for *pitch structures* and *formal structures*. You are welcome to study the piece together, but please make sure that the answers provided on the quiz are your own. **Be sure to bring the score and reduction to class,** electronically or in print.

Finally, consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a Twitter essay or a blog post, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there. If you submitted a blog post last week, please revise it for Monday/Tuesday based on the comments received. Either update your Google doc to reflect the suggested improvement, or respectfully respond to the comment about why you choose not to make the revision. Then click "resolve" for each comment.



## Prep for February 4/5

Consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a Twitter essay, blog comments, or a Wikipedia edit/presentation, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there. 

Wikipedia groups will be writing/presenting on Brahms's "Lerchengesang." However, there is not yet a Wikipedia article on that song. Instead, please write new material in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1XwWmxSn2mYaYQ1n_pOaQSuRWupV8KQK1IcOCJM3ygPg/edit?usp=sharing) (anyone can view, but you need your CU login to edit). When both groups from both sections have contributed/edited, I will propose it to Wikipedia for inclusion. Their editor(s) will make the acceptance decision after reading our submission — so let's make it good!

All students, please review the class notes on "Lercehengesang" in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). And then consider the question given at the end of Monday's/Tuesday's class, and come prepared to offer your insights on that topic as we discuss.


## Prep for February 2/3

Download a score for Johannes Brahms's "Lerchengesang," (movement 2 of his [Op. 70 song cycle](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/3/32/IMSLP77280-PMLP52805-Brahms_Werke_Band_25_Breitkopf_JB_154_Op_70_filter.pdf)), read the [text and translation](http://www.recmusic.org/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=3582) (by Karl Candidus), and listen to a recording of it.

<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5gMScqEe1pZCyM0kGZlosr" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><br/>

Spotify URI: spotify:track:5gMScqEe1pZCyM0kGZlosr  
Spotify web player URL: http://open.spotify.com/track/5gMScqEe1pZCyM0kGZlosr

Then take [an online quiz](http://goo.gl/forms/iFbFHNgrrW) about the musical structure of the song. This will serve two purposes: preparing for more in-depth discussion, as well as an assessment opportunity for the Unit I musical course objectives.

Finally, consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). If you are due for a blog post, Twitter essay, or blog revisions, please see the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your written work according to the instructions provided there. 


## Prep for January 28/29

Consult the class writing schedule in the [shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbTMtV05UQU1RMEE&usp=sharing). 

If you are due for a Twitter essay, please follow the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and submit your assignment using the submission form linked there. Possible topics include "Gretchen am Spinnrade," "Erlkönig," the general nature of poetry, and basic ideas on the setting of poetry to music. ***Say as much as you can within the 140-character constraint.*** Use each character, word, hashtag strategically. There is no need for filler. On the contrary, the delete button will be your friend.

If you are due for blog comments, please check your email for a notification, or login to Google Drive and click on "Incoming" or "Shared with me." You will have a classmate's blog post shared with you. Open it, read it, and leave at least one substantive comment to help them improve their writing. See the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) for more details.

If your group is due for a Wikipedia edit, please see the instructions on the [writing guide](mt4-writing.html) and apply them to [the Wikipedia article on "Erlkönig."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Erlk%C3%B6nig) (Focus on the section labeled "The Franz Schubert composition.") Be prepared to present what you updated and why *briefly* in class on Wednesday/Thursday.

Everyone else, please review the Google Doc from class (in the shared folder), and come prepared to discuss the song in more detail and to respond to your classmates' Wikipedia updates. In particular think about:

- Who is in control of the tonality of the song? In other words, which characters seem to be able to stay in a key for a long time, to bring it to a cadence? Which characters begin in keys set by others? Which characters can begin in any key the choose?  

## Materials for January 26–29

Score for [Schubert's "Erlkönig,"](http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/IMSLP15041-SchubertD328_Erlk__nig_4th_version.pdf).

## Prep for January 20/21 (Tuesday/Wednesday)

Please read the following:  

- [Analyzing poetry](http://openmusictheory.com/analyzingPoetry.html) on *Open Music Theory*, a short but helpful guide by Jonathan Sircy, English professor at my former institution.  
- [The Twitter Essay](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/the-twitter-essay/), an introduction to what we'll be doing with Twitter this semester, by Jesse Stommel.

Then take a stab at completing a Twitter essay (by yourself or with your group from class) that sums up, exemplifies, or engages something from Monday's/Tuesday's class. Use the hashtags #TwitterEssay and #poetry in your Twitter essay. You can bring them to class on paper, in the Google Doc we worked in during class, or you can tweet them from your own account.

Optional: You may be interested in reading/listening to Jonathan's new article in the journal *Hybrid Pedagogy*: [Faithful Listening.](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/faithful-listening/) It may be a helpful guide to engaging texts and texted music this semester, as well as an insight into what your professors are (and aren't) doing when they grade your written work. :)

## Prep for January 14/15

Please read the [syllabus](theory4.html) and [writing guide](mt4-writing.html), and bring any questions you have about them to class on Wednesday/Thursday.

Optionally, sign up for a [Twitter](http://twitter.com) account that you would like to use for this class. 

If you will be using Twitter for this class, please [add your username/handle to this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xqbqYU89V50G9LDg5fEh5OUYA05QfCjXVZEiN6ci5EQ/viewform?usp=send_form).
