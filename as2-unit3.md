title: Unit II&#58; Basic chromaticism and 6/4 chords (Aural Skills II)
author: Kris Shaffer

# Unit III: More chromaticism and applied chords #

Unit III will continue to reinforce basic concepts of diatonic melody and harmony and standard rhythm, as well as skills in performing and recognizing musical structures by ear. New topics inlcude the eighth-note beat in simple meter, leaping melodic chromaticism (incomplete chromatic neighbor tones), and applied (or secondry) dominant chords.

## Materials ##

In addition to exercises in the Berkowitz and/or Kazez texts, the following materials will be assigned or may supplement assigned materials in order to help you meet the goals outlined under *Concepts and assessment*, most of which can be found on Kris Shaffer's [Musicianship Resources](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship) website (which also contains helpful review materials). This list will grow throughout the unit as new resources are created or assigned.

#### Fundamentals ####

- [Protonotation](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/protonotation.html).  
- [Meter and time signatures](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/meter.html).  
- [Pitches and octave designations](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/pitches.html).

#### Harmony ####

- [Harmonies (Roman numerals and functional bass) by scale degree - handout](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/Graphics/Handouts/HarmoniesByBassScaleDegree.pdf).  
- [Classical cadence types](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/cadenceTypes.html).  
- [Applied chords](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/musicianship/appliedChords.html).  

#### Performance and listening ####

## Concepts and assessment ##

The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the [assessment guide]({{ root_url }}/as2-assess.html)) in Unit II are divided into three categories: *rhythm*, *melody*, and *harmony*. Those with deadlines in Unit II are listed below (though others will be addressed in class activities), followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as "I can . . ."

#### Rhythm ####

- perform straight, dotted, and syncopated rhythms in simple meter, with preparation (eighth-note beats) – 1x.  
- dictate/transcribe straight and dotted rhythms in simple meter, quickly and without an instrument (eighth-note beats) – 1x.  
- dictate/transcribe syncopated rhythms in simple meter, quickly and without an instrument (eighth-note beats) – 1x.  

#### Melodic pitch elements ####

- perform diatonic melodies with steps, small leaps, and arpeggiations of I and V<sup>7</sup>, from sight – 1x.  
- perform diatonic melodies with any triadic arpeggiations, with preparation – 1x.  
- dictate/transcribe diatonic melodies with any triadic arpeggiations, quickly and without an instrument – 2x.  
- dictate/transcribe diatonic melodies with chromatic incomplete neighbor tones, quickly and without an instrument – 2x.  

#### Harmonic pitch elements ####

- dictate/transcribe harmonic progressions containing passing and neighbor 6/4 chords, quickly and without an instrument – 2x.  
- dictate/transcribe harmonic progressions containing applied/secondary-dominant chords, quickly and without an instrument – 2x.  
- recognize harmonic progressions by ear and notate with Roman numerals, quickly and without an instrument – 2x.  

In-class or take-home/online assessment activities will be given for all of these concepts and skills, as well as some concepts and skills that have deadlines in future units. These assignments and quizzes will provide sufficient opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery by the unit deadline. Additional attempts then become the responsibility of the student to be submitted or performed during office hours.
