Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## Assignment for February 2/3

First, **sign up for a sight-reading exam** with your instructor. (Shaffer students can [sign up on this Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY). Please check your time zone when you sign up. All exams take place between 8am and 9am on February 3.)

Prepare for your sight-reading exam using modulating melodies from the Karpinski anthology not sung/played in class. The sight-reading melodies on the exam will be similar to these in that they are relatively short and will modulate once to a closely related key.

Second, **create a video of yourself singing "Der Neugierige,"** the sixth movement of Schubert's ["Die schöne Müllerin."](http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/f/f6/IMSLP03233-Schubert_dsm_em.pdf) Practice (and/or record multiple takes) until it is perfect or very close. Sing with solfège syllables that reflect the keys and modulations that you hear in the piece. Feel free to use a recording and/or an instrument as you prepare your performance.

To submit your video, first name the file "LASTNAME – Der Neugierige". Then upload it to Google Drive and share the file with your instructor. If you have concerns about the technology, check with your instructor well before the deadline.

Good luck!

## Prep for January 28/29

Look at the above assignments for February 2/3. You are encouraged to begin preparations early. If you have any questions about the video assignment or the exam, ask them in Wednesday's/Thursday's class.

Bring Schubert's Erlkönig and Karpinski Anthology, Chapters 69–70, to class again.


## Prep for January 26/27

Please read [Chapter 69]() and [Chapter 70]() of Gary Karpinski's *Manual for Ear-Training and Sight-Singing* (located in the [class shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cUEltQjJYREdhRE0&usp=sharing)).

Then download and print a [score to Schubert's song, "Erlkönig,"](http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/IMSLP15041-SchubertD328_Erlk__nig_4th_version.pdf) and listen to a recording (two are provided below). Mark every modulation you hear on your score. Remember that a modulation requires a *cadence* in a new key, so analyzing cadences would be a good place to start. You are welcome to do this work with one or two partners.

Also, please print and bring the Karpinski *Anthology* melodies from Chapters 69 & 70 (in the same [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cUEltQjJYREdhRE0&usp=sharing)) — or download them to a device that you can read off of during class while singing and/or playing your instrument. Keep these with you for the next few class meetings.

## Prep for January 14/15

Please read the [syllabus](auralskills4.html) and [unit 1 guide](as4-unit1.html), and bring any questions you have about them to class on Wednesday/Thursday.

Finally, bring your primary instrument to class (unless it is piano or something else difficult to travel with).
