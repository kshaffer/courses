Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).


## Prep for Feb 23/24

First, please complete the melodic transcription begun in class on Wendesday/Thursday, Feb. 18/19, and submit to your instructor. Audio can be [downloaded here]() (link to be added after the Thursday classes). (You will need to be logged into Google Drive with your CU account.) Beginning tonic is G. Be sure to transcribe the vocal melody *and* indicate the ending key. 

Second, please transcribe *all four parts* (two violins, viola, and cello) to [this musical excerpt](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/file/d/0B9o4hmKNoi6cd2MwbEZKN29Cb0k/view?usp=sharing) (begun in class on Feb 18/19), and provide appropriate harmonic labels (key(s), Roman numerals, and figured bass/inversions). The beginning tonic is A. Use your ears to determine the mode (major/minor), if/when/where it modulates, and the meter. This is the first of several take-home four-part transcription opportunities. You only need pass two of them to pass the objective that counts towards your grade (see [syllabus](auralskills4.html)), so you are more than welcome to consider this first attempt a practice exercise. 

Before beginning the four-part transcription, you may find it helpful to watch or review [the demo video](https://vimeo.com/119572881). It is also embedded below.


## Prep for Feb 18/19

Please complete the melodic transcription begun in class on Wendesday/Thursday, Feb. 11/12, and submit to your instructor. Audio can be [downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/file/d/0B9o4hmKNoi6cdXlYcjA3UXRSVEE/view?usp=sharing). (You will need to be logged into Google Drive with your CU account.) Beginning tonic is E. Be sure to transcribe the vocal melody *and* indicate the ending key. 

Then watch [the demo video](https://vimeo.com/119572881) on transcribing four-part harmonic textures (embedded below).

Finally, please bring staff paper (and for Shaffer's section, a decent pair of headphones) to class each day until the end of the unit.

## Prep for Feb 16/17

Monday/Tuesday, February 16/17, will be the second round of sight-reading exams. If you passed instrumental or sung in the Week 4 exam, prepare to do the other in this exam. If you did not pass your Week 4 exam, choose whether you want to assess sight-reading at an instrument or sung with solfège. You can use the modulating melodies from the Karpinski Anthology for practice (located in the [class shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cUEltQjJYREdhRE0&usp=sharing)).

Kris Shaffer's students can sign up for their exam time on [this Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY). (Please double-check your time zone when you sign up. All exams will take place between 8am and 9am.)

## Prep for Feb 11/12

There is no assigned work for Monday/Tuesday. Please bring headphones to class.

## Assignment for February 2/3

First, **sign up for a sight-reading exam** with your instructor. (Shaffer students can [sign up on this Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBSdnp2TjN5X3lvfGRlZmF1bHR8MDA3M2NiNTMyNjU1OGM3YmIxY2EwMGM1NzllM2VhMjY). Please check your time zone when you sign up. All exams take place between 8am and 9am on February 3.)

Prepare for your sight-reading exam using modulating melodies from the Karpinski anthology not sung/played in class. The sight-reading melodies on the exam will be similar to these in that they are relatively short and will modulate once to a closely related key.

Second, **create a video of yourself singing "Der Neugierige,"** the sixth movement of Schubert's ["Die schöne Müllerin."](http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/f/f6/IMSLP03233-Schubert_dsm_em.pdf) Practice (and/or record multiple takes) until it is perfect or very close. Sing with solfège syllables that reflect the keys and modulations that you hear in the piece. Feel free to use a recording and/or an instrument as you prepare your performance.

To submit your video, first name the file "LASTNAME – Der Neugierige". Then upload it to Google Drive and share the file with your instructor. If you have concerns about the technology, check with your instructor well before the deadline.

Good luck!

## Prep for January 28/29

Look at the above assignments for February 2/3. You are encouraged to begin preparations early. If you have any questions about the video assignment or the exam, ask them in Wednesday's/Thursday's class.

Bring Schubert's Erlkönig and Karpinski Anthology, Chapters 69–70, to class again.


## Prep for January 26/27

Please read [Chapter 69]() and [Chapter 70]() of Gary Karpinski's *Manual for Ear-Training and Sight-Singing* (located in the [class shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cUEltQjJYREdhRE0&usp=sharing)).

Then download and print a [score to Schubert's song, "Erlkönig,"](http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/7/7c/IMSLP15041-SchubertD328_Erlk__nig_4th_version.pdf) and listen to a recording (two are provided below). Mark every modulation you hear on your score. Remember that a modulation requires a *cadence* in a new key, so analyzing cadences would be a good place to start. You are welcome to do this work with one or two partners.

Keep these with you for the next few class meetings.
