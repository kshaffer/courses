Find assignments under the class date in which the assignment is due. They are in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).

## Prep for January 14/15

Please read the [syllabus](auralskills4.html) and [unit 1 guide](as4-unit1.html), and bring any questions you have about them to class on Wednesday/Thursday.

Also, please read [Chapter 67 of Gary Karpinski's *Manual for Ear-Training and Sight-Singing*](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/file/d/0B9o4hmKNoi6cTUhxVnFjNzVTV3c/view?usp=sharing) (located in the [class shared folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cUEltQjJYREdhRE0&usp=sharing)).

Finally, bring your primary instrument to class (unless it is piano or something else difficult to travel with).
